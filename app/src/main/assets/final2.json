In India it occurs along the Western Ghats from Kerala to Gujarat, also Palnis and Shevaroys, in the north from Mussoorie eastwards, to north-east India and onto Myanmar. == Status == Papilio helenus is generally common and not threatened. It is commonly found from Kerala to Maharashtra, but rare in Gujarat. It is also found in abundance in north-east India, and very commonly sighted in Assam. == Taxonomy == === Species group === Papilio helenus is the nominate member of the helenus species group. The members of this clade are: Papilio helenus Linnaeus, 1758 Papilio iswara White, 1842 Papilio iswaroides Fruhstorfer, 1898 Papilio nephelus Boisduval, 1836 Papilio nubilus Staudinger, 1895 Papilio sataspes C. & R.

Common and one in Taiwan: P. h. fortunius Fruhstorfer, 1908. == Life cycle == This butterfly flies throughout the year in southern India. === Eggs === The egg is pale apricot-yellow in colour when freshly deposited, spherical in shape and has a slightly roughened exterior which looks like the skin of an orange when seen through a microscope. The diameter of an egg is 1.2 mm. The eggs are deposited singly on the tips of very young leaves and shoots in shady parts of thick jungle. Before hatching, the eggs appear to be marked by chocolate coloured lines and flecks. The egg hatches in 4 to 7 days. === Caterpillar === The freshly emerged larva is about 3 mm long. Throughout the caterpillar stage, if it is agitated it can evert a yellow-to-red osmeterium from the first segment, just behind the head. Each of the other segments bears, on the back, a pair of tufts of stiff hairs, each tuft arising from a small, yellowish conical process. The overall colour is brown, but there is a whitish saddle-like patch about the middle and the tail segments are also whitish in colour. Like other Papilio species the larva can evert a two-pronged horn-like osmeterium when it is irritated. The osmeterium secretes an repugnatorial|unpleasant-smelling liquid which is believed to repel predators and parasites. After the first moult the caterpillar has the appearance of a shiny bird dropping. The larva is grass green in colour, mottled black and white and smoky grey. The osmeterium, when everted, is generally yellow to red. While inactive, mainly during daylight hours, the young larva lies along the midrib of the underside of the leaf. Later on, when it is largely fully grown, it is greener and lies on the centre of the upperside of the leaf, on a stem or a twig. The fifth instar larva is about 5 cm long.","family": "Papilionidae","genus": "Papilio"}, {"kingdom": "Animalia","cmname": "Common gem Male left, female right","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","phylum": "Arthropoda","stname": "Poritia Hewitsoni","species": "hewitsoni","Wikipedia": "Poritia hewitsoni, the common gem, is a small butterfly found in India, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam that belongs to the lycaenids or blues family. == Range == It ranges along the Himalayas from Kumaon to Assam in India and onto Myanmar.

It is a common butterfly generally found in the wet forested hills of southern Asia, from India and the Himalayas east through Indo-China. The upper surfaces of the wings are dark brown with white bands and small white spots towards the tip of the wings. == Range == This butterfly is found in Myanmar, Thailand, western China, Malaysia and the Indonesian archipelago (Borneo, Sumatra, Java and Bali). It occurs in India wherever its preferred forest habitat - moist, deciduous, semi-evergreen and secondary evergreen forests with a basically natural, varied herb and shrub vegetation - is present. It ranges from South India through Maharashtra to Bengal, and along the Himalayas from Kashmir to Assam and Arunachal Pradesh (Mishmi hills); and also the Andaman islands. It flies from plains level to 8,000 feet (2,400 m) in the Himalayas. The type locality of this species is the Himalayas. == Status == It is common. It is the commonest of all Celaenorrhinus species occurring in India. The best period to see the common spotted flat is during the rainy season and months immediately after. The population decreases as winter and summer progresses and rises once again at the next monsoon. == Description == The butterfly has a wingspan of 45 to 55 mm. It is dark brown above. The forewing has a band of more or less connected discal spots, which are white and semi-transparent. Of this band, two spots, i.e. the one in end cell, and that at 2; are rectangular and connected to more or less degree. The butterfly also has small white spots in the apex of the forewing. The hindwing has a few obscure, opaque yellow spots. The hindwing margins are chequered black and white. The male has plain white antenna shafts, while the female has plain brown shafts with white clubs. It is a very variable species. === Detailed description === Edward Yerbury Watson (1891) gives a detailed description, shown below: All wings dark brown; some spots and a minute dot in the middle of the forewing, a small crescent at the apex, all transparent snow-white; on the upper surface of the hindwing four spots, on the under surface a larger number irregularly placed and yellowish, the borders white, interspersed with dusky. Of median size, hindwing rounded at the outer margin, not elongated, the colour of all the wings above and below dark brown. In the middle of the forewing are three snow-white transparent almost quadrangular spots of which the hind one is the smallest, there is also a dot near the middle spot. Near the apex a crescent-shaped spot. On the hindwing several small yellow spots irregularly arranged; four on the upperside more or less obsolete, and seven on the underside almost punctiform, the outer five in acurved row near the outer margin. The fringe of the forewing brown with several whitish spots, on the hindwing alternately yellowish-white and brown. Head and body brown and hairy, the palpi yellowish- white clothed with brown hairs above; two yellow spots at the nape. Club of the antennae snow-white, below brown. == Habits == The common spotted flat flies in the wet jungles of the peninsula and the Himalayas. It is a shade-loving insect, rarely venturing out of the forest, except early in the morning, late in the evening or when it is overcast. It visits flowers and rests on the undersides of leaves. Its long proboscis permits it to feed from flowers having long tubular corollas. It visits Impatiens, Asystasia, Blepharis, Peristrophe, Crossandra and other Acanthaceae shrubs and herbs which are abundant in the dappled environs of the forest edge where this butterfly is most likely to be found. The butterfly can also be spotted mud-puddling occasionally. When active, the common spotted flat alternates between sun and shade, flying in the open patches for a while and resting a while when in the shade. As it is a wary butterfly which rarely settles on the top of bushes, resting instead mostly on the undersides of leaves, it is difficult to get a good look at the common spotted flat in the field. Its fast, zig-zagging flight also makes it difficult to track while in the air. It flies fast and low, usually below 6 feet, and aggressively defends its territory from other butterflies. When disturbed, it buzzes in circles around before settling down, near to where it was perched before. This species, like others of its group, is distinguished by its habit of keeping its wings spread flat; the behaviour which gives these butterflies their name. == Life cycle == === Eggs === The egg of the common spotted flat are green, dome-shaped, glossy and have many small longitudinal ridges with smooth surfaces in between. The egg is laid on the young leaves of plants in shady places, both above and below the leaf surface. The eggshell forms the first meal of the newly hatched caterpillar. === Caterpillars === After eating the eggshell, the first instar caterpillar constructs a cell from a triangular piece of leaf which it folds over the upper surface of the leaf. It lines the inside with silk. Here, the caterpillar resides till it outgrows the cell, whereupon it proceeds to construct a larger one, purse shaped using two leaves where it rests with head turned on the side. If disturbed, the caterpillar raises its front over the back with legs outstretched and jaws open. The caterpillar is dark olive green with a dorsal wavy line of deeper tinge. It has a paler coloured band running along the spiracles throughout the length of the body. The legs and underside of the caterpillar are pale green. The skin is dull, transparent and is covered with minute whitish hairs. Its heart-shaped head is glossy, dark with a rufous tinge, and having a flat base below. === Pupa === The caterpillar pupates in a cell, sometimes on fresh leaves, at other times on dead leaves or even in the leaf litter. The pale reddish-golden pupa is cylindrical, widest at the thorax, tapering quickly towards the head and gently towards the rear. The head has a small rounded protuberance. The pupa is firmly fixed to the silk pad. === Host plants === The food plants are mostly common Acanthaceae shrubs from semi-evergreen, deciduous and secondary evergreen forests. The caterpillars have been recorded on Asystasia gangetica, Ecbolium linguistrinum, Eranthemum roseum, Nilgirianthus heyneanus, Nilgirianthus barbatus, Carvia callosa and Thelepaepale ixiocephala.","family": "Hesperiidae","genus": "Celaenorrhinus"}, {"kingdom": "Animalia","cmname": "Yellow pansy Male, Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Uganda Female, Andhra Pradesh, India","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","phylum": "Arthropoda","stname": "Junonia Hierta","species": "hierta","Wikipedia": "Junonia hierta, the yellow pansy, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in the Palaeotropics.

On the hindwing the black markings of the underside on the basal and discal areas are not only seen by transparency from below, but are actually represented, though only partially, by black scaling; the width of the dark grey terminal portion is also greater, and it has a tendency to turn to dusky black anteriorly, so that the sub-terminal series of black lunules are obscured anteriorly and are difficult to make out. Underside: markings similar to those of the typical form, but broader; forewing with the discal transverse band that reaches from costa to vein 1; hindwing: the black bands that cross the cell broader and proportionately closer together. It has a 94\u2013100 mm expanse. Males and females. Upperside bluish-white.

Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen creamy white, with a medial broad longitudinal stripe; beneath, the abdomen with lateral black stripes. It has a wingspan of 68\u201395 mm. == Status == This butterfly is fairly common and tends to be local. It is not known to be threatened. == Habitat == Generally found in deciduous forest areas, among bushes with lesser secondary growth. Locally abundant below 3,000 feet (910 m) and less common above this level. Generally stays close to hilly and forested country. == Habits == It is shy and wary. It flies close to the ground and has a dodgy and fast flight, especially when disturbed. They often visits flowers. Spot swordtails may be seen to cluster around flowering trees. They are fond of Gmelina arborea, a deciduous tree from dry areas. Large numbers can be seen settling on damp roads and wet patches, especially in hot summers. It basks close to the ground, with wings partially open or completely spread. It is a known migrant in Sri Lanka. == Life cycle == Individuals are active from February to June. They are most abundant in March\u2013April. It has been recorded in western India from July onwards for a few months. In the Nilgiris it has been recorded from February to October. === Eggs === Eggs are spherical, yellowish and slightly shiny. They are laid singly on the upper surface or at the margin on the under-side of young leaves or buds. === Larva === The larva is black with a green underside. It has white transverse stripes. The anterior and posterior segments are yellowish. It has a pair of spines on each thoracic and anal segments. Glossy green osmeterium. It is a sluggish caterpillar which feeds mainly in the evening and at night. Not so thick proportionally at the fourth segment as those of agamemnon, sarpedon and doson, and is somewhat quadrangular. It has four pairs of spines which are small but sharp. The most usual colour......is black, banded on the sides with narrow white stripes, except on the first three or four segments and the last., on which there is more or less rusty red ; but the shade varies very much, and in some the groundcolour is green.

During and after the monsoon it is extremely abundant. == Description == The upperside of male is velvety black. Forewing with well-marked pale adnervular streaks on the discal area that do not reach the terminal margin, the latter broadly velvety black; the streaks beyond end of cell extended inwards into its apex. Hindwing with elongate white discal markings in interspaces 2\u20135 beyond the cell. In dry-weather specimens these markings are very short and do not nearly reach the bases of the interspaces; beyond these a curved series of subterminal lunular markings in interspaces one to seven dull crimson irrorated with black scales, the spot in interspace one large, irregular, diffuse, margined interiorly with white.

(Rothschild quoted in Bingham) == Varieties == There are up to 20 subspecies. The nominate sub-species occurs throughout peninsular India. The subspecies include: P. a. aristolochiae Fabricius. India. Very common. P. a. sawi Evans. Car Nicobar. Not rare. P. a. camorta Moore. Central Nicobars. Not rare. P. a. goniopeltis Walter Rothschild. Andaman islands. Not rare. Also found in Myanmar. P. a. kondulana Evans. South Nicobars. Not rare. The subspecies P. a. ceylonicus Moore is found in Sri Lanka and is very common. == Habitat == An excellent generalist which has adapted to a range of habitats, the butterfly has been found in congregations at lower elevations. The common rose is found up to 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) in the Western Ghats and south Indian hills, up to 1,500 metres (5,000 ft) at the eastern end of the Himalayas but only up to 910 metres (3,000 ft) in the north-west Himalayas. The butterfly is a common visitor to Indian gardens and can even be found in crowded urban areas. == Habits == It is the commonest of the large-tailed butterflies of India. The red body, slow peculiar flight, bright colouration and pattern of the wings are meant to indicate to predators that this butterfly is inedible, being well protected by the poisons it has sequestered from its larval food plant. It also emits a nasty smelling substance when handled to further enhance its unappealing qualities. Hence it is rarely attacked by predators, a strategy so successful, that edible butterflies have evolved to mimic it, the classic example being that of the female morph of the common Mormon that is Papilio polytes, female form stichius. The common rose frequently visits flowers such as Lantana, Cosmos, Zinnia, Jatropha and Clerodendron. The butterfly occasionally also visits wet patches. In parts of Sri Lanka, the males are known to congregate and form a beautiful sight while mud-puddling. The common rose is active much earlier in the morning than most butterflies and remains so throughout the day until dusk. It flies just as readily in the shade as in the sun, and frequently visits flowers. In drier regions, around noon, the butterfly rests in thickets to avoid the mid-day heat. Here, it will rest and venture forth only in the late afternoon once again. In the evenings, it retires into wooded areas or thickets in search of dead twigs or small branches on which to roost. It prefers sites that are 10 to 15 feet above ground, below the canopy in trees with sufficient cover from the elements, where it frequently roosts in the company of others of its type, and, sometimes, in the company of the crimson rose. It flies high, slowly and often descends to nectar on flowers below. On such occasions it often dives down with its wings held back, and as it approaches the flower, the wings open up to provide deceleration. The butterfly primarily depends on motive thrust on the powerful flapping of its forewings while the hindwings act as a balancing and steering mechanism. This flying technique gives a rather unusual look to its flight and an observer is left with the impression that it is dragging itself through the air with only the assistance of its forewings. The common rose is often the preferred species to show the amateur naturalist the utility of the tails in steering. This can be most easily observed when the common rose hovers over flowers to sip nectar. Then, its forewings beat readily to give it buoyancy while the tails move delicately to steer and adjust its position. It has been considered in the past that these tails are primarily for deception as in the case of the Polyommatinae where the thread-like tails resemble antennae and confuse the attacker as to the location of the head. On occasions, roses have been observed with damaged tails and it is possible that the presence of swallowtails occasionally does favour the butterfly in confusing attackers. == Life cycle == === Eggs === The female has been observed inspecting Aristolochiaceae plants and selecting healthy plants with verdant growth to ensure adequacy of food for its voracious caterpillars. It lays round and reddish eggs with fine black markings. The eggs are laid singly on top, the underside of leaves or even on shoots. === Caterpillar === The caterpillar is a velvety-maroon colour and has a white band on a segment on its middle reminiscent of a belt or collar. It has numerous fleshy red-tipped white protuberances on the body. It is bulky and slow in its movements. === Pupa === The pupa is brownish with various shades of brown and pink markings. It is attached to its support by the tail and held at an angle by a body band. The support is usually a stick. The distinguishing feature of the common rose pupa is the presence of large semi-circular projections on the back of the abdomen, thorax and head. == Food plants == The larvae feed on creepers and climbers of the genus Aristolochia, family Aristolochiaceae, and they sequester toxins such as aristolochic acid in their bodies. This makes the adults toxic to vertebrate predators such as birds and reptiles. However the braconid wasps which parasitise the caterpillars have apparently co-evolved with the butterfly and are not affected by the toxins.

Forewing has the costa narrowly and terminal margin more broadly fuscous brown, the latter with in addition an anticiliary black line; cilia light brown transversely traversed close to but not at their bases by a dark brown line. Hindwing: costa narrowly fuscous brown; a subterminal series of black spots outwardly edged by a white line; the spot in interspace 2 the largest and inwardly crowned more or less broadly with ochraceous yellow; an anticiliary black line and the cilia as on the forewing. Underside: greyish brown. Forewings and hindwings: the following transverse darker brown markings on each wing, the markings edged on the inner and outer sides with white lines\u2014a short bar across the discocellulars, a discal catenulated (linked like a chain) band, the posterior two elongate spots of which on the forewing are en echelon, while the band on the hindwing in bisinuate and is capped anteriorly near the costa by a round black spot encircled with white; the above are followed by maculated (spotted) inner and outer subterminal bands, which on the hindwing are curved and more or less interrupted on the tornal area by a comparatively large round black spot in interspace 2 and a smaller similar spot in interspace 1, both spots inwardly crowned with ochraceous; the white edgings on the inner side to both subterminal bands on the hindwing are more or less lunular. In addition on the same wing there is a subbasal curved row of four white-encircled spots, of which the anterior two and the spot on the dorsum are black, the other dark brown. Antennae black, shafts ringed with white; head, thorax and abdomen brown, the head and thorax clothed with bluish hairs; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen whitish. Female upperside: brown. Forewing: shot with blue from base outwards for a little over half its length down its middle, this blue irroration not extended to the costal margin; a slender anticiliary black line. Hindwing: a touch of blue iridescence near base; terminal markings much as on the forewing but the subterminal spots larger and not extended beyond interspace 6; in addition postdiscally there is a lightening of the shade of the ground colour, between which paler area and the subterminal spots the ground colour assumes the form of a postdiscal, short, transverse lunular band. Underside of female as in the male, the markings slightly larger and more clearly defined. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male but slightly paler. === Dry-season brood === Very similar to the same sexes of the wet-season brood, but can be recognized by the following differences: Upperside: Male ground colour slightly duller; subterminal spots on the hindwing less clearly defined. Female: The blue shot area extended outwards on the forewing for three-fourths of its length from base, but as in wet-season specimens not reaching the costal margin; on the hindwing the blue suffusion covers the entire medial portion of the wing from the base to the subterminal row of spots, of which latter the spot in interspace 2 is entirely without the inner ochraceous edging. Underside: ground colour darker than in specimens of the wet-season brood, the discocellular and discal transverse bands on both forewings and hindwings broader, the terminal markings very ill defined, the inner white edging to the inner of the two subterminal transverse bands broadened and very diffuse. On the hindwing the discocellular and discal bands coalesce and form an ill-defined diffuse medial cloud on the wing. == Distribution == The species resides in peninsular India south of the outer ranges of the Himalayas, but not in the desert tracts and somewhat local; Ceylon: Assam: Burma; extending into the Malayan subregion. == Subspecies == Chilades pandava pandava Chilades pandava vapanda (Semper, 1899) (Philippines) Chilades pandava lanka (Evans, 1925) (Sri Lanka) == Life cycle == === Larva === When full-grown a little over half an inch in length, of two distinct colours, some being bright green, others of a dark reddish purple (vinous) .... head very small, black, shining and hidden beneath the second segment, the third segment larger than the second, the other segments about equal in size, the anal segment flattened and rounded, divisions between the segments well-marked. The larva throughout is very rough, widely pitted or depressed and covered with very minute white tubercles bearing very short fine hairs, neither the hairs nor the tubercles being visible without a lens. The body at its highest and widest part is wider than high. It is extremely variable in its markings, hardly any two being exactly alike; there is usually a dark, dorsal, subdorsal and lateral line dividing the upper surface of the body into three equal areas, the dorsal and two subdorsal lines coalescing on the eleventh segment and forming a broad band to the thirteenth. In some specimens the divisions between the segments are marked with darker and there is a subdorsal series of oblique dark lines, one on each segment between the dorsal and subdorsal lines. The underside of the body and legs seems to be always green. The erectile organs on the twelfth segment very small, feeds in Calcutta on Cycas revoluta. In Calcutta three species of ants attend this larva, which Professor Forel has identified for me as Prenolepis longicornis, Latr., Monomorium speculare, Mayr and Crematogaster, n. sp. (Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville quoted in Bingham) === Pupa === Of the usual Lycaenid form, quite smooth, more or less fuscous, with a darker dorsal and subdorsal line, head-case somewhat square, thorax slightly humped and constricted posteriorly, spiracles pale. Though the larva swarm in April and May in Calcutta on the cultivated cycads in gardens, eating the hardly opened shoots or fronds, thereby utterly destroying the appearance of the plant for the year, I have never succeeded in finding the pupa on the plants, and can only conclude that the ants drive the full-grown larvae down the stems of the plants into their nests, where the larvae undergo their transformations.

The forewing base, costal margin broadly and discoidal cell except at its lower apical area are heavily irrorated (speckled) with dusky-grey scales with a short streak at upper apex of cell joined to a large spot on the discocellulars, black; superposed on the black terminal area are two small preapical spots and a much larger subterminal spot in interspace 3, all of the white ground colour; minute white terminal specks also, often more or less obsolescent, in the interspaces. Hindwing more uniform, very slightly irrorated with grey scales at base, the black terminal band immaculate. Underside: greenish yellow sparsely sprinkled with black scales, the yellow very pale on the disc of the forewing, fading to white along its dorsal margin; discocellular spot and three subterminal posterior spots, that are placed in a curve, black; the lowest spot of the three sometimes extended to the dorsal margin (var. puellaris). Hindwing: uniform, with a very small annular spot on the discocellulars. Cilia white. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the antennae speckled and tipped with white, the thorax clothed with long bluish-grey hairs; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. The female upperside is very similar to that of the male, with her terminal bands broader and brownish rather than black. The female's underside base and cellular area on forewing white are suffused with greenish yellow, while the costa and apex of forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing are pale ochraceous. The forewing has black spots as in the male, while the hindwing in a few specimens has an anterior, discal, somewhat obscure, macular, incomplete band. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen are the same as in the male. === Dry-season brood === Similar to the wet-season brood, but on the upperside the black markings are duller in tint and narrower, while on the underside in both sexes the costal and apical areas on the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing vary from pale ochraceous to dark reddish ochraceous. Variety peelus, Swinhoe, has the ground colour on the upperside pale canary yellow. == Distribution == It is recorded from Baluchistan, the Punjab and western India (Kutch; Rajasthan; Sindh and Madhya Pradesh).

It is a dull black or brown butterfly with a semi-transparent spot on the wings and sometimes with no visible spots. The underside of the wings is grey brown with diffused dark spots. The male and female are similar in shape and colour and with hardly any differentiation. Both sexes of the flat are similar in appearance, being dull brownish black above and greyer in colour below. The butterflies have small, semi-transparent discal, cell and apical spots. The dark spots on the underside of the forewing are large, dark and diffused. == Status, distribution and habitat == This species is most commonly visible at the end of the rainy season, but sparsely found in the post-monsoon months. It is common but not abundant in most habitats. The spotted small flat (Sarangesa purendra), though, is more common in the arid regions. It occurs in openings and edges in both the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, deciduous forests, and scrub & short grassland savannahs. It is found in the Deccan plains and also in the hills, but more frequently found at lower elevations. Except for the very dry north-west India, it occurs commonly throughout the country, in Sri Lanka and in the Indo-Chinese region. == Habits == The butterfly though tiny, flies extraordinarily fast but in an erratic and jerky fashion. Though the flight seems jerky and erratic, the butterfly lands smoothly on the substratum, and that too suddenly. It fight is always close to the ground and has the habit of sometimes returning to the same spot for perching. It feeds on flowers of herbs and small bushes and also rarely on birds' droppings and wet rocks for minerals. It always keeps its wings spread. It almost always rests on the underside of leaves, but basks on the upperside with its wings fully spread. == Larval host plants == Its larval host plants are Acanthaceae herbs and small shrubs; Asystasia species and Blepharis asperrima. These species grow in neglected places around human habitations, in deciduous forests and openings in evergreen forests. == Subspecies == Sarangesa dasahara dasahara (north-western Himalaya to Burma, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, southern Yunnan) Sarangesa dasahara albicilia Moore, [1881] (Sri Lanka) Sarangesa dasahara davidsoni Swinhoe, 1912 (India: Maharashtra)","family": "Hesperiidae","genus": "Sarangesa"}, {"kingdom": "Animalia","cmname": "Spot puffin","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","phylum": "Arthropoda","stname": "Appias Lalage","species": "lalage","Wikipedia": "Appias lalage, the spot puffin, is a small butterfly of the family Pieridae, that is, the yellows and whites, which is found in India, Indochina and Hainan.","family": "Pieridae","genus": "Appias"}, {"kingdom": "Animalia","cmname": "Tawny coster Male, Cambodia Underside, Kerala, India","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","phylum": "Arthropoda","stname": "Acraea Violae","species": "terpsicore","Wikipedia": "Acraea terpsicore, the tawny coster, is a small, 53\u201364 millimetres (2.1\u20132.5 in), leathery, winged butterfly which is common in grassland and scrub habitats. It belongs to the Nymphalidae or brush-footed butterfly family. It has a weak fluttery flight. It is avoided by most insect predators. This species and the yellow coster (Acraea issoria) are the only two Indian representatives of the predominantly African tribe Acraeini. == Description == === Male === Upperside tawny. Forewing: a transverse black spot in cell, and another irregular, oblique and broader at the discocellulars; a discal series of spots in interspaces 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10, and the apex and termen black. The upper four spots of the discal series inclined obliquely outwards, the lower two obliquely inwards; the black edging to apex and termen narrowing posteriorly, but with slender linear projections inwards in the interspaces. Hindwing: a basal series of four or five black spots with a similar spot beyond in middle of cell and a subcostal black spot above it, followed by a discal series of obscure blackish spots and a minute postdiscal black dot in interspaces 4 and 6 respectively; finally, a broad black terminal band medially traversed by a series of small spots of the ground colour. Most of the macular black markings are obscure, being only the spots on the underside seen by the transparency of the wing membrane; the inner edge of the black terminal band crenulate. Underside ground colour ochraceous yellow or a paler tawny yellow. Forewing: paling to whitish on the apex, with the black markings as on the upperside but somewhat blurred and diffuse. Hindwing: the black spots and black terminal band as on the upperside, but the spots more clearly defined, none obscure; the series of spots traversing the black terminal margin very much larger and white - not tawny; the base of the wing black, separated from the basal transverse series of black spots by two or three large whitish spots. Antennae black, head and thorax black spotted with ochraceous and white; abdomen anteriorly black, posteriorly ochraceous yellow with narrow transverse black lines; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen ochraceous, the thorax spotted with ochraceous, the abdomen with a longitudinal line of black at base. === Female === Similar to that of the male. Upperside ground colour duller; the black spots on forewings and hindwings larger, the upper discal spots often coalescing and forming an irregular oblique short band; the black edging to apex and termen on the forewing and the black terminal band on the hindwing proportionately broader, the spots traversing the latter larger and whitish. Underside ground colour much paler and duller markings as on the upperside and, as in the male, the spots on the hindwing better defined than on the upperside. Antennae, bead, thorax and abdomen as in the male. Wingspan of 53\u201364 mm. == Distribution, habits and habitat == This species does not fly high, but seems to keep within 3 m of the ground and tends to rest on vegetation in the regions of a meter off the ground. Acraea terpsicore can be seen in abundance wherever its larval food plant (Passiflora species) is found. The adult tends to avoid dense undergrowth and shady areas, instead keeping to open spaces in all types of vegetation. The adult flies slowly with weak seemingly unsteady wing beats. It is one of the boldest butterflies, protected as it is from predators by a nauseous chemical. When attacked it plays dead and exudes an obnoxious yellowish fluid from glands in the joints of the legs. Like all butterflies protected in this manner, Acraea terpsicore has a tough exoskeleton which enables the adult to survive a few pecks of a bird or even the bites of a lizard. Once left alone the adult immediately takes off and resumes its uncaring flight. When feeding on flowers, this butterfly is unhurried, often spending a long time sitting on the same flower. When sitting it either spreads its wings or closes them over its back the hindwings covering the forewings to a large extent. Sometimes the butterfly will not sit, but rest gently on the flower while feeding, while doing this, to maintain balance, it beats only its forewings while keeping the hindwings completely steady. === Mating plugs === The tawny coster is one of a group of butterflies where females feature a sphragis (copulatory plug) which is formed after a mating session. After males produce the spermatophore, they pass an additional gland secretion (a waxy substance) that spills out of the female's copulatory opening, forming a mating plug that hardens within a few hours for the purpose of preventing further matings. == Life cycle == The butterfly breeds on plants of the family Loganiaceae and species of Passiflora many of which contain toxins that are sequestered by the caterpillars. They have also been noted to feed on the leaves of Hybanthus enneaspermus (Violaceae) in Bengal and on Turnera ulmifolia (Turneraceae) in Maharashtra. === Eggs === Eggs are laid in batches of anywhere between 20 and 100. Eggs are yellow and slightly elongated and tall and display shallow transverse ribbing. === Larva === The fully grown caterpillar is about 21 mm (0.83 in) in length. It is reddish brown on the upperside and a yellowish white on the underside. Each body segment bears a number of branched spines. The head is reddish. The caterpillars of a batch tend to feed gregariously and devour all soft tissue of the host plant. In this manner they can become a major menace to the passion flower plant they are feeding on. Like the adults, the caterpillar is protected by the toxins, processed from the Passiflora species. Cylindrical, slender, with six longitudinal rows of fine branched spines; colour reddish brown with an oily gloss, much paler on the head, second and last segment; an unwholesome looking insect, doubtless protected like the butterfly. (Davidson & Aitken) === Pupa === The pupa boldly marked with aposmatic colours, advertising the fact that this is an unwholesome object if eaten. It is white with thick black lines, spots and markings in red and orange. The pupa hangs freely from the support without the aid of a band. The pupa is 17 mm (0.67 in) long. Perpendicularly hung, long, slender, smooth; two lateral angles on the thorax; head quadrate; colour creamy white, with broad longitudinal bars of purplish-black spotted with orange.

The upperside of forewings and hindwings is black, while the underside is black and brown. Also the body is completely black. Forewings have a blue band at the wavy outer edge, a blue or white spot at the wing leading edge and a little white spot in the wing tip. Hindwings show a wide blue transversal band, with a row a small black spots and a narrow blue band at the outer very wavy edge. Frederic Moore wrote in 1899: Males and females upperside deep indigo-blue black; a postdiscal slightly sinuous blue band crossing both fore and hind wings, on the fore wing commencing immediately below a preapical white spot just beneath the costa and broadening gradually to the dorsum, on the hind wing broadening from the costa and extending to vein 1. On the fore wing this band is crossed by the black veins, the portion in each interspace, except in la and 1, rounded interiorly; anteriorly beyond the cell a short broad obliquely-placed bar joins the band almost to the costa. On the hind wing this band is traversed along its outer margin by a series of small black dots. On both wings there are some transverse, more or less broken, subterminal and terminal linear blue marks, more clearly defined and more continuous on the hind wing. In the female, the postdiscal band is broader than in the male. Underside brownish black, covered thickly with short transverse jet-black striae; the basal halves of the wings defined outwardly by a highly sinuous, somewhat broken, jet-black broad line; some similarly coloured transverse short broad marks in and below cell of fore wing; apex of fore wing broadly pale brown, that colour continued as a very broad irregular discal band to the dorsum; touched at the costa and outwardly near the tornus with greyish white; beyond this band a curved postdiscal sinuous series of jet-black lunules followed by a black subterminal ill-defined line, both the latter commencing at the falcate angle of the termen and extending to the tornus. Hindwing with a white spot at apex of cell and a continuation of the pale discal band of the fore wing, but far less prominent, much narrower and sinuous; beyond this the terminal half of the wing dull black, the transverse short striae very sparse, but with a transverse postdiscal series of minute black dots as on tharonicahe upperside. Antennae black, flecked with minute ochraceous dots; head and thorax dark blue; abdomen dull black; beneath, the palpi and thorax with slightly bluish long hairs, the abdomen black flecked with white. Subspecies K. c. haronica closely resembles the typical form, but on the upperside the ground-colour at the bases of the wings is sometimes suffused with green, the transverse broad blue band is discal not postdiscal, and anteriorly is continuous with the broad short oblique bar beyond the cell, not commencing as in canace below the preapical white spot. On the hind wing the band is without the series of black dots, but beyond it then is a transverse postdiscal row of small blue spots. Underside as in canace but the ground-colour paler. === Larva === Subspecies K. c. canace Segments alternately orange and white, with numerous black spots on the orange segments and black streaks on the white; seven white, branching, black-tipped spines on each orange segment. Subspecies K. c. haronica Light red; spotted with black, the segments divided by blackish and purple lines; anal segment slightly humped; segments armed with eight longitudinal rows of yellow branched spines; head and legs black. Feeds on Smilax. (Moore, 1899) === Pupa === Subspecies K. c. canace Variegated reddish brown, with frontal gold and silver spots; head produced and bifid. Subspecies K. c. haronica Reddish brown; abdominal segment with two dorsal rows of small reddish pointed tubercles; thorax angular; headpiece he is a good emperor produced and bifid. (Moore, 1899) == Biology == Larvae grow on various Smilacaceae species (Smilax aspericaulis, Smilax bracteata, Smilax china, Smilax lanceifolia, Smilax perfoliata, Smilax riparia, Smilax sebeana, Smilax sieboldii, Heterosmilax japonica) and Convallariaceae species (Streptopus amplexifolius, Tricyrtis hirta) and Liliaceae (Lilium lancifolium). == Habits == This species is highly territorial and will chase butterflies that move into its territory. It uses well defined perches and will bask with wings open but often sits with half-open wings. == Distribution == This very widespread species can be found as far north as southeastern Siberia, west to Japan and Korea, east to India and Taiwan and south to Sri Lanka, Burma and parts of Indonesia with a number of well marked geographic races.","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","(moore": "1899)","stname": "Kaniska Canace","cmname": "Blue admiral Upperside in Coorg, India Underside view","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Kaniska"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "cinnara","family": "Hesperiidae","Wikipedia": "Borbo cinnara, commonly known as the rice swift or Formosan swift, is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae.

The pupae are yellowish with numerous black spots; constricted in the middle; head produced into two points. There are several subspecies under Doleschallia bisaltide: Doleschallia bisaltide andamanensis Fruhstorfer, 1899 The Andaman autumn leaf closely resembles the Indian form, but differs in the oblique yellow band on the upperside of the forewing, which is broader and extends from the middle of the costal margin uninterruptedly to interspace 4, though it is preapically constricted. On the upperside of the hindwing there is an inner as well as an outer conspicuous subterminal narrow-black band. On the underside this subspecies is as variable as the typical form, but the ground colour in many specimens (presumably wet-season broods) is of a richer, almost metallic green, with the basal snow-white spots defined with black lines; the ocelli in interspaces 2 and 5 seem also to be more clearly defined than in the Indian form. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in malabarica. This subspecies has been seen in the South Andaman (Chidiyatapu), Car Nicobar, Central Nicobars and at Great Nicobar.

The ground colour varies from reddish to dark greenish brown with irrorations of greyish and black scales; apex of the forewing and the terminal margin posteriorly of the hindwing more or less lilacine; forewings and hindwings crossed by a dark narrow discal fascia, generally bordered on the inner side by a greyish line; this fascia bent inwards at right angles above vein 6 of the forewing and in most specimens, bordered internally by a diffuse pale patch and externally by an oblique whitish mark, beyond which is a subcostal white spot, followed by a transverse sinuous postdiscal series of obscure ocelli crossing both wings, each ocellus centred by a minute dot, white on the fore, black on the hindwing. In the male there are generally, but not invariably, a number of whitish spots on the basal areas of both wings. Antennae blackish brown, ochraceous at apex; head, thorax and abdomen dark fulvous brown; beneath, the palpi white, the thorax and abdomen pale brown. Wingspan is about 84 to 88 mm (3.3 to 3.5 in).

The butterfly is very common in India up to an altitude of 1800 m. == Subspecies == Spialia galba galba (Pakistan, India, Kashmir, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Ceylon, Thailand) Spialia galba shanta Evans, 1956 (Burma) Spialia galba chenga Evans, 1956 (China: Hainan) == Description == Having a wingspan of only 24 to 27 mm, Spialia galba is identified by its unique pattern of black and white spots and its small size. The upperside is dark brown to black in colour with a light brown gloss and many small white spots. The wings have a chequered fringe. The underside is whitish. Sexes are identical. == Habits == When sunny, the butterfly is found flying close to the ground and basking with the wings partly open. The forewing is partly closed while the hindwing is held fully open. It rests with wings closed. It has a swift, twisting but usually short flight. The Indian skipper visits flowers, preferring those with small flowers such as Tridax procumbens, (a common weed in India) and species of Dicplitera or Bidens. It sleeps on hanging grass blades and the tips of the branches of herbs. == Life history == === Egg === The egg is shiny, light green, dome shaped, ridged and fused together. The female lays her eggs anywhere and on any position of the young shoots of its food plant. === Caterpillar === The caterpillar is pale green with a wavy dark green line dorsally. It is cylindrical, but thicker in the centre and tapering towards the ends. The body is clothed with fine whitish bristles and a line of long white hair on both sides. The head of the butterfly is obscured by dark hair and the jaws are orange red and black tipped. The second segment of the early instars is dark brown and has a golden central bar on the nape. As the caterpillar matures, it develops prominent black-bordered orange markings on the neck. The caterpillar resides in a folded leaf secured from all sides except the entrance. It feeds in the late evenings and nocturnally. === Pupa === It has a thick, cylindrical, greyish-green pupa which tapers towards the abdomen. It is covered with fine dirty-white bristles near the head and eyes. === Food plants === Malvaceae: Hibiscus spp. Sida rhombifolia Sterculiaceae: Waltheria indica Melochia corchorifolia","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","stname": "Spialia Galba","cmname": "Indian skipper","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Spialia"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "clytia","family": "Papilionidae","subgenus": "Chilasa","Wikipedia": "Papilio clytia, the common mime, is a swallowtail butterfly found in south and south-east Asia. The butterfly belongs to the Chilasa subgenus, the black-bodied swallowtails. It serves as an excellent example of a Batesian mimic among the Indian butterflies. == Description == == Form clytia == Both males and females have the upperside velvety black or soft dark brown. Forewing: a subterminal series of outwardly truncate or emarginate white spots; the spot in interspace 4 shifted inwards out of line; those in interspaces 6, 7 and 8 oblique to the costa, the lowest and the upper two spots elongate; this is followed by a terminal series of smaller white spots, two in interspace 1, one above the outer, and two in interspaces 8; lastly, a single spot between the subterminal and terminal series. Hindwing: a discal series of inwardly conical and outwardly emarginate, triangular, elongate white spots; a prominent tornal yellow spot broadly divided across the middle by a bar of the ground colour. The cilia touched with white in the interspaces; sometimes one or more of these specks on the cilia are broad and prominent and yellow in colour. Underside: from soft pale brown to rich dark velvety brown. Forewing with the markings as on the upperside. Hindwing: the markings also similar to those on the upperside, but the terminal margin beyond the subterminal series of white markings bears a row of comparatively large very conspicuous yellow spots, separated from the white lunules by a series of short transverse detached spots of the ground colour. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the thorax anteriorly and beneath and the abdomen on the sides spotted with white. == Form dissimilis == Form dissimilis, Doubleday differs from the first form as follows: Upperside, forewing: cell with four streaks coalescent at base and four spots beyond at apex, a long streak in interspace 1a, two streaks with two spots beyond which are more or less coalescent with them in interspace 1, a broad streak with an outwardly emarginate spot in interspace 2, similar spots, one at base and one beyond, in 3, a single similar spot in 4, elongate streaks in 5 and 6, and much smaller elongate spots in interspaces 8 and 9. All these streaks and spots cream-white with diffuse edges; subterminal and terminal markings as in the first form. Hindwing: markings similar to those in the first form with the following differences: discoidal cell entirely white, discal white streaks longer that reach quite up to the outer margin of the cell and are continued anteriorly to the costa by elongate streaks in interspaces 6 and 7, two spots in interspace 8 and a slender streak along the costa; the subterminal and terminal markings as in the first form. Underside similar to the upperside, the cream-white markings slightly larger, the terminal series of yellow spots on the hindwing as in the first form. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the typical clytia form; the head, thorax and abdomen with more prominent white spots. Wingspan: 108\u2013121 mm === Other forms === Many variations have been described and given names in the past, and many of these names may no longer be valid. Variety casyapa, Moore \u2013 Forewings, besides the marginal and submarginal markings with a third discal series of one to five markings. (Rothschild quoted in Bingham) Variety papone, Westwood \u2013 Forewings black, with an obvious bluish tint in certain lights; the white spots absent from the forewings or only faintly indicated. (Rothschild quoted in Bingham) Variety commixtus, Rothschild \u2013 Forewings black or bluish black, with a marginal, submarginal and a subdiscal series of most feebly marked spots, and with two faint spots behind the cell and a streak along the inner margin (dorsum) white; the discal markings are often indicated by a few white scales, or are entirely absent. Hindwings with apical half of the cells, seven long discal streaks reaching the base of the respective cellules (interspaces?) ( the first and the last reach the base of the wing) and a marginal and submarginal series of spots white as in ab. dissimils, L. This aberration and examples intermediate between it and clytia I received from the Khasia Hills. (Rothschild quoted in Bingham) Race lankeswara (Sri Lanka) Moore \u2013 Differs from P. clytia in the umber-brown colour of the wings and in the small submarginal spots of the forewings; from P. clytia panope, it is distinguished chiefly by the longer discal sagittiform spots of the hindwings. This subspecies has been described from slightly aberrant specimens in which the submarginal spots of the forewings are partly obliterated; in most individuals the series of these spots is complete, and on such specimens Moore's clytioides is based. (Rothschild quoted in Bingham) The dimorph or dissimilis form of this race is identical with that of P. clytia. Race panope, Linn. (Myanmar and into Siam and the Malay Peninsula) \u2013 The discal sagittate spots of the hindwings are shorter than in P. clytia, sometimes they have almost disappeared from the upperside. Most frequently the marginal and submarginal markings of the forewings are more or less merged together, and form in the apex of the wing three large patches. (Rothschild quoted in Bingham) The dimorph or dissimilis form of this race also resembles that of the typical form. Variety janus, Fruhstorfer \u2013 The subterminal and terminal white markings on the forewings only faintly indicated or replaced by small black spots centred sometimes with obscure white. The white sagittate subterminal markings with obscure white. The white sagittate subterminal markings on the hindwing are in most specimens small and obscured by an irroration of dark scales. Race flavolimbatus, Oberth\u00fcr (The Andamans) \u2013 Closely resembles the dissimils form of clytia; differs as follows: both males and females distinctly larger, the white markings similar but proportionately larger, with the exception of the streaks in the discoidal cells of both forewings and hindwings, which are narrower and less firmly defined; on the hindwing there is a terminal row of ochraceous-yellow spots on the upper as well as on the underside, while those on the underside are very much larger than in P. clytia, dimorph dissimilis. The dark form clytia or any race of it is apparently unknown in the Andamans. == Distribution == This butterfly is found in India from Kangra to Sikkim, from Assam to Burma, Nepal, Bangladesh, Peninsular India and the Andaman Islands. It is also found in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Southern China (including Hainan), Hong Kong, Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea, peninsular Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia (Flores, Alor, Timor and Moa). Several regional variants and forms are recognized. == Status == Generally common and not threatened. The nominate subspecies is protected by law in India. == Habitat == This is a butterfly of hilly regions but also found at lower elevations. It is plentiful in the pre-monsoon and monsoon period and becomes scarce later on. == Habits == The common mime has two mimetic forms in both sexes. The nominate form P. clytia form clytia mimics the common Indian crow (Euploea core) while the form dissimilis mimics the blue tiger (Tirumala limniace). The flight of the mime also resembles that of the model, fluttering, neither weak nor strong, sometimes staying close to the ground and at other times flying strongly up into the treetops. It mud-puddles on stream banks in summer. Known to bask and usually sits with the wings spread wide open while feeding on nectar from flowers. == Life history == === Eggs === Spherical, shiny and orange yellow, laid on the upper surface of leaves. === Larva === The larvae and pupa are stated by Mackinnon to resemble closely the larva and pupa of P. agestor. Davidson and Aitken's description of them is as follows: Not unlike the larva of the Ornithoptera group in form, having similar rows of fleshy processes, but it is by far the handsomest Papilio larva we know, being of a dark umber-brown colour with a bright red spot at the base of each process, a dorsal row of large irregular yellow patches and a partial lateral row ending in a diagonal band which connects the two. Velvet black or dark green. Has carmine spots. Has a dark red-brown longitudinal band and red spots. Two rows of sharp spines on segments 1 to 4 and single row on the others. The osmeterium is light indigo blue. ==== Larval host plants ==== The larvae feed on species of the laurel family Lauraceae Alseodaphne semecarpifolia Cinnamomum camphora Cinnamonum macrocarpum Cinnamomum verum Litsea chinensis Litsea deccansis Tetranthera apetala === Pupa === Is unique, exhibiting one of the most remarkable instances of protective resemblance we know. It exactly resembles a dead twig about an inch long and less than a quarter of an inch in diameter, broken of irregularly at one end. The last segment is so modified that the pupa is not attached by one point, but appears as if it had grown out of the branch to which it affixes itself. An inch in length, brownish with streaks and blotches. Rough surface with tubercles. Has uncanny resemblance to a broken twig and is suspended at an appropriate angle. == Key to forms == From Bingham, C. T. (1907). The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma. Butterflies.

Forewing with the outer margin broadly washed with deep purple, the inner margin broadly pale ochreous; some pale streaks between the veins beyond the end of the cell; a round black spot at the extreme base of the wing with a spot of bright orange above it; hindwing with a similar but larger black spot. Antennae dark brown above, ochreous below; palpi with the third joint dark brown, the second and first with the outer edge brown, the rest orange, which is the colour of the legs, the underside of the body and the anal tuft. The female differs from the male only in being larger and darker, the upperside of the hindwing concolorous with the rest of the wing, not broadly pale ochreous as in the male. The male of this species closely resembles that sex of Bibasis harisa, Moore, but differs in the forewing being much narrower, and on the hindwing in having the costal pale patch more restricted; on the underside the markings are less prominent. == Habits == This butterfly is crepuscular. == Cited references ==","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","stname": "Burara Anadi","cmname": "Plain orange awlet Male (top), female and male underwing","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Bibasis"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "niphanda","family": "Nymphalidae","Wikipedia": "Symbrenthia niphanda (bluetail jester) is a species of Nymphalid butterfly found in South Asia.","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","stname": "Symbrenthia Niphanda","cmname": "Bluetail jester","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Symbrenthia"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "laeta","family": "Pieridae","Wikipedia": "Eurema laeta, the spotless grass yellow, is a small butterfly of the family Pieridae (the yellows and whites), which is found in India, Sri Lanka, China, Indochina, Japan and onwards to Australia. == Photo gallery ==","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","stname": "Eurema Laeta","cmname": "Spotless grass yellow","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Eurema"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "rhamni","family": "Pieridae","Wikipedia": "Gonepteryx rhamni (known as the common brimstone) is a butterfly of the Pieridae family. It lives in Europe, North Africa and Asia. Across much of its range, it is the only species of its genus, and is therefore simply known locally as the brimstone. The name butterfly is believed to have originated from the brimstone \u2014 which was called the butter-coloured fly by early British naturalists. == Description == On the upper side the male is sulphur yellow and the female white with a greenish tinge, but both have an orange spot in the centre of each wing. They never settle with their wings open and from the underside the sexes are more difficult to separate but the female is still paler. Their wing shape is unique among British butterflies (although there are similar, closely related species in southern and eastern Europe) and is designed to act as camouflage while they rest and during hibernation. == Distribution == G. rhamni lives in Europe, North Africa, South America and Asia as far east as Mongolia. It is widely distributed across the southern half of the United Kingdom and has been steadily increasing its range in the north of England, but is limited by the distribution of its larval foodplants and is quite possibly close to its maximum possible distribution now unless their foodplants' range also increases. In Ireland, it has a much more localised distribution. == Life cycle == G. rhamni is one of the longest lived butterflies, living up to thirteen months, although most of this time is spent in hibernation. As it is often the first butterfly to be seen in the spring, sometimes as early as January when hibernating adults are awoken on a sunny day, there is a popular myth that it is this butterfly which gave us the word butterfly, a corruption of butter-coloured fly. The eggs are laid singly on the leaves of either common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) or alder buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) \u2013 the only two food plants \u2013 and females will wander far and wide in search for these particular shrubs. The larvae and pupae are both green and very well camouflaged making them difficult to find in the wild. Upon emerging from the pupae, brimstone butterflies spend the summer feeding on nectar to build up energy reserves for the winter and by the end of August they are already beginning their long sleep. They seek out evergreen scrub, a favourite being dense, old ivy growth. The brimstone usually hides until early spring, although a warm January day will occasionally wake an eager male. There is only one brood a year.","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","stname": "Gonepteryx Rhamni","cmname": "Common brimstone Male in flight, Dry Sandford Pit, Oxfordshire Male at Parsonage Moor, Oxfordshire","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Gonepteryx"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "hector","family": "Papilionidae","Wikipedia": "Pachliopta hector, the crimson rose, is a large swallowtail butterfly belonging to the genus Pachliopta (roses) of the red-bodied swallowtails. == Range == It is found in India and Sri Lanka and possibly the coast of western Myanmar. In India, it is found in the Western Ghats, southern India (Kerala), eastern India (West Bengal and Odisha). It is a straggler in the Andaman Islands. == Status == It is generally common and not known to be threatened. It is common all along the Western Ghats up to Maharashtra but rare in Gujarat. This species is protected by law in India. == Description == The male's upperside is black. Forewing with a broad white interrupted band from the subcostal nervure opposite the origin of veins 10 and 11, extended obliquely to the tornus, and a second short pre-apical similar band; both bands composed of detached irregularly indented broad streaks in the interspaces. Hindwing with a distal posteriorly strongly curved series of seven crimson spots followed by a subterminal series of crimson lunules. Cilia black alternated with white. Underside: forewing dull brownish black, hindwing black; markings as on the upperside, but the crimson spots and crescent-shaped markings on the hindwing larger. Antennae, thorax and abdomen above at base, black; head and rest of the abdomen bright crimson; beneath: iho palpi, the sides of the thorax and abdomen crimson. The female is similar, the discal series of spots and subterminal lunules much duller, pale crimson irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales; in some specimens the anterior spots and lunules almost white barely tinged with crimson; abdomen above with the black colour extended further towards the apex. No geographic races have been described. == Habitat == This butterfly is at home both in jungle and in open country. During the dry season, it will be found up to 8000 feet (2400 m) in South India, but it is found all the year round at lower elevations. == Habits == It is a very striking tailed butterfly with prominent white bands on its forewings. The crimson rose is very fond of flowers especially Lantana. Nectar appears to be essential for the butterfly and a higher nectar intake is thought to increase egg production. Close to the ground, the flight of the crimson rose is slow and fluttering but steady. At greater heights, it flies faster and stronger. It basks with its wings spread flat, sometimes in small congregations at heights of 10 to 15 metres up in the trees. The butterfly often roosts for the night in large companies on the twigs and branches of trees and shrubs, sometimes accompanied by a few common Mormons. When resting the butterfly draws its forewings halfway between the hindwings. The butterfly sleeps on slanting outstretched branches or twigs of trees or bushes. === Aposematism and mimicry === The red body, slow peculiar flight, bright colouration and pattern of the wings are meant to indicate to predators that this butterfly is inedible, being well protected by the poisons it has sequestered from its larval food plant. Its flight and behaviour is much like that of the common Mormon. Like that butterfly, it too is inedible and rarely attacked by predators. This has led to this butterfly also being mimicked by a female morph of the common Mormon (Papilio polytes), in this case, the female form romulus. === Migration === The most striking aspect of the butterfly's behaviour is its strong migratory tendencies. During the peak of its season, several thousand crimson roses can be found congregating and then they begin migrating to other areas. In the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine, 1880, p. 276, Mr. R. S. Eaton notes that in Bombay this butterfly roosted in great numbers together, however Charles Thomas Bingham notes that in the Western Ghats between Vengurla and Belgaum, where the butterfly occurred in some numbers and had the habit of roosting in company on twigs of some thorny shrub, but never saw more than a score or so together. == Life cycle == Higher numbers of them are seen from August to November and also from April to June. They breed up to seven times per year and it has been found to take only 39\u201347 days from egg to adult. === Eggs === Similar to those of the common rose, the eggs hatch in seven days. === Caterpillars === The caterpillars of the crimson rose are similar to those of the common rose, but are purplish black or blackish brown. They have a black head and orange osmeterium. Their bodies are fat, with orange-red tubercles and a prominent yellowish-white band transversely placed on segments six to eight. The caterpillar has five instars. The caterpillars are known to display cannibalistic behaviour. === Pupa === The pupa is pinkish brown with darker expanded wing cases. The wing-like expansions on the abdomen are distinctive. === Food plants === The larvae of the species breed on various species of Aristolochia including Aristolochia indica, Aristolochia bracteolata, and Thottea siliquosa. The species is unpalatable as they sequester chemical compounds in their larval stages including aristolochic acid from the host plants. === Nectar resources === The nectar sources of the crimson rose with details of the flowering period are as follows: Adathoda zeylonica January\u2013March Albizzia lebbeck March\u2013June Anacardium occidentale December\u2013March Antigonon leptopus year-long Bougainvillea spectabilis year-long Caesalpinia pulcherrima year-long Capparis spinosa December\u2013February Carissa carandus year-long (April\u2013July) Catharanthus roseus year-long Citheroxylum subserratum April\u2013June Clerodendrum infortunatum February\u2013April Duranta repens June\u2013December Hibiscus rosa-sinensis year-long Hyptis suaveolens September\u2013January Jasminum angustifolium June\u2013August Lantana camara year-long Muntingia calabura year-long Nerium odorum year-long Premna latifolia March\u2013August Sida acuta August\u2013December Sida cordifolia August\u2013December Stachytarpheta indica June\u2013September Wrightia tinctoria April\u2013June Zizyphus oenoplia August\u2013December and March\u2013June == Etymology == In common with other early naturalists Linnaeus followed the classical tradition.

Hindwing: yellowish white, all the reins very broadly bordered with black; interspaces 1, 2, 6, and 7 with crossbars of black, beyond which there is a subterminal, somewhat broad, transverse band of black between veins 2 and 6. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings white alternated with black. The ground colour on both upper and undersides variable, often cream coloured above; beneath: in some specimens, the base of cell and the elongate spots in apical area of forewing, and the whole surface of the hindwing varies to rich chrome yellow. Female similar; the black markings on both upper and undersides broader, the white spots on black apical area of forewing often sub-obsolete above. Antennae in both sexes black, sparsely sprinkled with white dots; head, thorax and abdomen above and below white: thorax above often bluish grey. === Dry-season form === The dry-season form is similar to the wet-season form but on the upperside the black markings are narrower, the white markings on the black apical area of forewing broader and longer, and on the hindwing the narrow inner margining to the black on the termen very narrow, somewhat obsolescent; therefore, the white subterminal spots have the appearance of opening inwards. Underside: ground colour almost pure white; on the hindwing slightly tinged with yellow. Antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen as in the wet-season form. Wingspan of 44\u201362 mm. Race taprobana, Moore. (Sri Lanka) Differs from the typical form as follows: Male upperside, forewing: deep black on apical area, the enclosed white elongate spots more or less obsolete. Hindwing: the black terminal border much broader and of a deeper black, the enclosed white spots, except the spot in interspace 6, very much smaller, somewhat obsolescent, sometimes absent in interspace 4. Underside: similar to the upperside, the markings of a very intense black and broader, the enclosed spots in the apical area of forewing, the white of the cell and the area along the upper half of the wing generally overlaid with rich chrome yellow. Hindwing: ground colour a deep rich chrome yellow, the spots on it enclosed in the black along terminal margin subhastate (somewhat spear shaped), the spot in interspace 4 absent. The female is similar to the male on both upper and undersides, but in most specimens, on the upperside, the spots of the white ground colour that are enclosed in the black apical area of the forewing and the spots on the black border along the terminal margin of the hindwing are entirely absent. == Distribution == The species lives in Sri Lanka, the Himalayas from Kashmir to Sikkim at elevations below 6,000 feet (1,800 m), and through the plains to Southern India. In the Nilgiris observed up to 8,000 feet (2,400 m) (Hampson). To the west it spreads through Persia and Arabia to East Africa. The species occurs over the greater part of Sub-Saharan Africa. It does not seem to occur in Assam or Burma, but I possess a specimen of the dry-season form taken by Mr. G. Kogers, Deputy Conservator of Forests, in April 1903, in the Ganges harbour, Great Nicobar Island. == Life cycle == Food plants of the larvae include Capparis zeylanica. In Africa, the host plants are almost exclusively from the family Capparaceae and in particular the genera Boscia, Maerua and Capparis. Eggs are laid in batches of 20 or so, while the newly hatched larvae are gregarious. === Larva === When hatched a line long, olive colour, with a distinct glossy jet-black head. After first moult. One fourth inch long; grass-green; dorsal line very distinct, dark green; lateral line very broad, plum-coloured and mottled, dentated into the ground-colour, on the last two segments on its upperside; a small white spot on either side of dorsal line on each segment; a yellow spot on each segment on the lateral line on either side; abdomen glossy green; ventral line distinct, rather interrupted, grass-green; all the legs green, hairy; head shiny black with a green triangular mark in front, covered with stiff whitish hairs; stigmata dark-coloured; sides greyish green, slightly wrinkled transversely; the portion of ground-colour between lateral and dorsal line slightly powdered with yellow; hair whitish grey; anal segment black and hairy; first segment rather swollen in front. After last moult length 1.25 inch long; cylindrical, broader towards the head, slightly tomentose on back, hairy on the sides; otherwise as after first moult Food plant, the pea-leaved caper (Capparis pyrifolia). === Pupa === Five-eighths of an inch long, transparent, pale cream-colour. In front a longish tubercle directed forwards, with a black mark on each side, and a smaller one on either side of 4th segment perfectly black; a lateral line of pale plum-colour, on which is a longitudinal line of yellow round dots, one on each segment, and a transverse row of dots on each segment; dashed and marked with black, particularly on the abdomen. After the escape of the imago, the 5th and 6th segments of the pupa become blood-red.","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","stname": "Belenois Aurota","cmname": "Pioneer white Male B. a. aurota in uMkhuze Game Reserve, South Africa Female B. a. aurota in Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Belenois"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "pasithoe","family": "Pieridae","Wikipedia": "Delias pasithoe, the redbase Jezebel is a medium-sized butterfly of the family Pieridae, that is, the yellows and whites.

Here, Delias pasithoe is used for the redbase Jezebel, based on the replacement name proposed by Linnaeus himself. == Description == === Male === Upperside: black. Forewing with more or less distinct, somewhat diffuse, broad streaks from base, in the discoidal cell and interspaces 1 and 2, the streak in the last the most produced; a white oval spot at lower apex of cell traversed by the lower discocellular, followed by a subterminal series of greyish-white hastate (spear-shaped) markings with their points turned inwards, the markings opposite the apex of the wing elongate and shifted a little inwards.

In this species the sexes are dimorphic. In males the dorsal sides of the wings are bright orange red, framed by a black outline with white spots. The undersides range from bright red to pale brown, interlaced by black and white. This astonishing pattern helps to disguise the shape of the butterfly, while the intense colour of the dorsal sides of the wings is a warning to predators that the red lacewing has a bad taste, deriving from the poisonous host plants of the caterpillars. The dorsal sides of the wings of the females are greyish-brownish with black spots and white bands and spots on the black margins. Caterpillars have several reddish, black and white stripes, a black head and long black spikes that contain poison. In fact they mainly feed on poisonous climbing plants, mainly Passiflora species (P. cochinchinensis, P. moluccana, etc.). == Distribution == This species can be found from the Indian subcontinent eastwards to South-East Asia and East Asia, the eastern limit being the Philippines, and the southern limit being Indonesia.","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","stname": "Cethosia Biblis","cmname": "Red lacewing","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Cethosia"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "hecabe","family": "Pieridae","Wikipedia": "Eurema hecabe, the large grass yellow or common grass yellow, is a small pierid butterfly species found in Asia or Africa. They are found flying close to the ground and are found in open grass and scrub habitats. It is simply known as the grass yellow in parts of its range; the general term otherwise refers to the entire genus Eurema. == Description == The common grass yellow exhibits seasonal polyphenism. The lepidopteran has a darker summer morph, triggered by a long day exceeding 13 hours in duration, while the shorter diurnal period of 12 hours or less induces a fairer morph in the post-monsoon period. === Male === Upperside: yellow, variable in tint from sulphur to rich lemon yellow according to locality with a light or heavy rainfall. Forewing: apex and termen deep black, this colour continued narrowly along the costal margin to base of wing, near which it often becomes diffuse; the inner margin of the black area from costa to vein 4 very oblique and irregular, between veins 2 and 4 excavate on the inner side, this excavation outwardly rounded between the veins and inwardly toothed on vein 3; below vein 2 the black area is suddenly dilated into a square spot which occupies the whole of the tornal angle; the inner margin of this dilatation is variable, in the typical form slightly concave. Hindwing: terminal margin with a narrow black band which is attenuated anteriorly and posteriorly; dorsal margin broadly paler than the ground colour. Underside: yellow, generally a slightly paler shade than that of the upperside, with the following reddish-brown markings. Forewing: two small spots or specks in basal half of cell and a reniform (kidney-shaped) spot or ring on the discocellulars. Hindwing: a slightly curved subbasal series of three small spots, an irregular slender ring or spot on the discocellulars, followed by a highly irregular, curved, transverse, discal series of spots or specks, some or all of which are often obsolescent. On both forewing and hindwings the veins that attain the costal and terminal margins end in minute reddish-brown specks. Antenna greyish yellow, the club black; head, thorax and abdomen yellow, shaded with fuscous scales; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen yellowish white. The sex-mark seen from above appears as a thickening of the basal half of the median vein on the forewing. === Female === Upperside: Very similar to that of the male but without the sex-mark; the black areas on both forewings and hindwings slightly broader, with the inner edge of the black terminal band on the hindwing often diffuse. Underside: ground colour and markings as in the male. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similarly coloured. === Dry-season form === Upperside: ground colour and markings much as in wet-season specimens, the emargination on the inner side of the black area and the tornal dilatation on the forewing similar. On the hindwing, in the great majority of individuals, the black terminal band is also similar, in a few it is narrower and diffuse inwardly in both sexes. Underside: ground colour similar to that in wet-season specimens, but in very many with a greater or less irroration of black scales over the yellow parts of the wing; the reddish-brown markings on both forewings and hindwings are also similar, but the spots are larger, more clearly defined, darker, and therefore far more conspicuous. In addition, on the forewing there is a preapical, very prominent, transverse, elongate spot or short bar or reddish brown extended downwards from the costa. This spot is irregular in shape and of variable width, but does not seem ever to spread outwards to the actual edge of the termen. In a few specimens there is also a small reddish-brown spot in interspace 1 near the tornus. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen, and in the male the sex-mark, as in wet-season specimens. == Life cycle == Eggs are laid on Abrus precatorius, Acacia species, Aeschynomene species, Albizzia species and numerous other Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae and Cucurbitaceae species. Studies suggest that the females can discriminate colours when choosing host plants for oviposition. Larva: Long, green, rough, cylindrical, or slightly depressed, with a large head. Pupa: Suspended by the tail and by a moderately long band; the abdominal segments are round, but the thorax is much compressed, the wing-cases uniting to form a deep sharp keel. The head-case terminates in a short pointed snout. Ordinarily the pupa is solitary and green, but sometimes on a twig in large numbers. Many Pierine and other larvae seek each others company at that time. Having selected a dead branch of some neighbouring bush, they acquired the colour of their surroundings as nearly all Pierine and Papilionine pupae do to a greater or less extent. This species has been found to be parasitised by multiple strains of Wolbachia. These bacteria can alter the sex ratios of the species. == Subspecies == E. h. albina Huang, 1994 (Fujian) E. h. amplexa (Butler, 1887) (Christmas Island) E. h. biformis (Butler, 1884) (Ambon, Serang) E. h. brevicostalis Butler, 1898 (Timer to Kai Island) E. h. diversa (Wallace, 1867) (Buru) E. h. hecabe E. h. hobsoni (Butler, 1880) (Taiwan) E. h. kerawara Ribbe, 1898 (Bismarck Archipelago) E. h. latilimbata (Butler, 1886) (Sumatra, Borneo) E. h. latimargo Hopffer, 1874 (Celebes) E. h. mandarina (de l'Orza, 1869) (Japan) E. h. maroensis (Butler, 1883) (Maroe Island) E. h. nivaria Fruhstorfer, 1910 (Solomons) E. h. oeta (Fruhstorfer, 1910) (West Irian to Papua) E. h. phoebus (Butler, 1886) (northern Australia) E. h. solifera (Butler, 1875) (Africa)","order": "Lepidoptera","class": "Insecta","stname": "Eurema Hecabe","cmname": "Eurema hecabe","kingdom": "Animalia","genus": "Eurema"}, {"phylum": "Arthropoda","species": "bianor","family": "Papilionidae","Wikipedia": "Papilio bianor, the Chinese peacock black swallowtail emerald or Chinese peacock, is a species of butterfly in the family Papilionidae, the swallowtails.

Several disjunct populations across its wide distribution range are considered as subspecies. Never a common butterfly, specimens of this species are highly prized by collectors. == Description == Forewing: costa arched; apex subacute; termen convex; tornus rounded; dorsum sinuate, ciliated, about three-fourths the length of the costa; cell about half the length of the wing; vein 6 out of 7 beyond apex of cell, upper discocellular therefore absent, middle and lower discocellulars subequal, vertical; vein 7 ends on termen well below apex of wing; vein 8 out of 7, from apical half, ends on costa before apex of wing; vein 9 out of 7 from just before middle; veins 10 and 11 free; vein 12 terminates well beyond end of cell on costa. Hindwing: irregularly pear shaped; costa slightly but widely angulated near base, then straight to apex; termen strongly rounded, tornus well marked, produced into a lobe; dorsum long, slightly convex; cell about half length of wing; middle discocellular short, concave, lower twice length of middle, strongly oblique; vein la very short, ends before middle of dorsum: vein 3 from well before lower apex of cell; vein 7 at base much closer to apex of cell than to base of wing; vein 8 very slightly arched near base, then straight to apex of wing.

The caterpillar has tiny antennae-like structures whose function is not known. The adult butterfly at emergence is covered in grey powdery scales which protect it from the ants. Eggs are laid singly or in groups of about six, on the underside of branches of a tree with ants' nest. The eggs are tiny pale green cylinders of 1 mm height. == Distribution == The species occurs from India to the Philippines, including the tropical coast of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. == Life history == === Egg === Very unlike that of other Lycaenidae but shows an unexpected resemblance to that of Logania, Distant, and Taraka, Doherty. It is of great size, green overlaid with white, shaped something like a section or drum of a Doric column but somewhat widest at the base, the height, breadth at apex and breadth at base being to each other as 9, 13 and 15.5. The top is marked with hexagonal reticulations, the lines turbinate in the middle, the margin deeply channeled and then strongly carinate. Sides crusted with white and minutely indented with about forty-five vertical ribs, slightly irregular and even (very rarely) anastomosing, extending also over the outer part of the base, the inner part being green and minutely reticulated with hexagons. (Doherty) === Larva === Oval flattened and slug like with a hard and smooth covering. The caterpillars can devour the entire broods of green ant nests. The protective orange carapace is virtually impervious to the bites of soldier ants and it is so heavy that the ants cannot flip it over to get at the caterpillar's soft underbody. Once the caterpillar transforms into a butterfly inside the nest, its soft body is vulnerable to the ants who can swarm and dismember intruders. However, as the butterfly quickly moves toward an exit, it is protected by white scales from its new wings; the scales are slippery enough to prevent most ants from getting a foothold and these scales stick to the ants' jaws, disorienting and distracting them. The jaws would most effectively take hold of the skin of an ant larva, piercing its skin at the same time in six places; they would then draw the piece so seized within the closed cavity formed between the labrum, labium and (laterally) maxillae so that the juices of the larva could be easily sucked out. (T. A. Chapman) === Pupa === The pupa inside lies quite free from any attachment to the skin, but the ventral depression of the pupa is due to its having to fit on the ventral aspect of the larval skin, which is raised centrally by the head, legs, prolegs etc. The larval skin dehisces by cracking round the marginal crest in front, by a crack across the front of the three ridges, i.e. between third and fourth abdominal segments. The semicircular portion thus marked off again divides longitudinally into two portions. (T. A.

It is found in gardens, fallow land, and open wooded areas. == Description == It is brown with numerous eye-spots as well as black and lemon-yellow spots and lines on the upperside of the wings. The underside is a dull brown, with a number of wavy lines and spots in varying shades of brown and black. There is also an eyespot on the lower side of the forewing. The wet and dry-season forms differ considerably in coloration and even shape. In the wet-season form the markings are distinct and vivid and the wing shape is a little more rounded. In the dry-season form the markings are obscure and pale especially on the underside and the wing margin is more angular and jagged. This helps it camouflage in the dried leaf-litter. The lemon pansy is a very active butterfly and can be seen basking with its wings open facing the sun. It sits very low to the ground and can be approached easily. It feeds with its wings half open. It is a fairly strong flier and flies close to the ground with rapid wingbeats and often returns to settle back in the same spots. == Life cycle == === Eggs === Eggs are laid singly on the underside of leaves. The egg is green and barrel-shaped with longitudinal ridges. === Caterpillar === The caterpillar is cylindrical, uniformly thick and covered with rows of spines which are branched at the tip. It is dull black with a faint blue sheen and has dorsal stripe of a darker color. There is a distinct orange ring behind the head. The caterpillar stays on the underside of the leaf and if disturbed, rolls up and drops to the ground. === Pupa === Pupation takes place in dense foliage close to the ground. The pupa is compact, with small conical processes on its rough surface. The pupa is well camouflaged with varying shades of brown with fine streaks and lines. === Food plants === Caterpillars feed on plants from the families Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, Malvaceae, Rubiaceae, Tiliaceae and Verbenaceae.

The tips of the forewing diverge outward and is a feature that is clear when they rest on vegetation. == Description == The coon is a small butterfly with a wingspan of 36 to 46 millimetres (1.4 to 1.8 in). Both sexes look alike, excepting that the male has a prominent brand on the under forewing. It is a plain brown coloured butterfly on the upperside. Underneath, the butterfly is similarly coloured but paler. There are diffused greyish-purple markings on the tip of the under forewing and a series of pale spots in spaces 4 to 9. Similarly spots can be seen on the under hindwing in spaces 2 to 7 and at the end cell. == Distribution and status == The butterfly ranges from India to Southeast Asia and the Indonesian archipelago. India forms the western boundary of the coon with the butterfly found in the Western Ghats in peninsular India, and from Assam to Arunachal Pradesh, other states of the northeast India and into Bangladesh and southern Myanmar. In southeast Asia, the coon flies in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, northern and southern Vietnam, Laos, Philippines, and possibly southern China. In the Indonesian archipelago, the coon flies in Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Sipora, Bali, Palawan, Sulawesi and Banggai. The butterfly is common in India. == Subspecies == There are three subspecies: P. f. fuligo - found in Thailand, peninsular Malaysia and archipelagos of Indonesia and Philippines. P. f. subfasciatus (Moore, [1879]) - found in India, Myanmar, Indo-China. P. f. fuscula (Snellen, 1878) - Sulawesi, Banggai. == Natural history == The butterfly is a weak flier which prefers to stay low and frequent shady nooks or grassy patches in forested areas. Often seen perched on leaves. The characteristic identification of this butterfly is that the tips of the forewings of the butterfly remain spread apart even when the wings are closed. The recorded food plants of the larva are all from family Marantaceae: Maranta arundinacea Schumannianthus virgatus Stachyphrynium spicatum (Roxb.) K.Schum.

The butterfly has historically been called the nigger, but it has been renamed in Australian faunal works to the socially acceptable name of smooth-eyed bushbrown. == Description == Orsotriaena medus is a medium-sized butterfly with wingspan of 45 to 55 mm (1.8 to 2.2 in). The butterfly is dark brown above with a thin marginal pale border. The upper hindwing having a thin submarginal line. There are no eyespots on the upperside of the wings. Below, the butterfly has a white discal band which runs across both wings. It has five eyespots on the underside of the wings. In the forewing, it has two eyespots, with the anterior eyespot slightly smaller. In the hindwing, it has two eyespots on the apical region and a separate ocellus in the tornal (hindmost) region. The uppermost of the eyespots in the hindwing are greatly smaller, while the remaining two are more or less of equal sizes. The eggs are spherical and yellowish. They are laid on the leaf blades and stems of grasses. The larvae are spindle shaped, transversely wrinkled, and covered in small tubercles, giving it a rough appearance. Two long brown spines on the head point forward, while a pair of pinkish prongs project from the anal segment. The colour above is rosy red with a blue dorsal and a white lateral line, below which, the underparts are green. The pupae are perpendicularly suspended, slender and regular, except that the head-case is produced into a long beak formed of two thin processes like split straws. The colour is whitish brown to yellow, with faint bands of a darker shades. It resembles a large grain of barley or a tiny banana. Orsotriaena medus superficially resemble members of the genus Mycalesis (bushbrowns), but can readily be identified by the number of spots. == Distribution and habitat == Orsotriaena medus is native to India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, southern Yunnan, Malaysia, the Indonesian archipelago, the Philippines, New Guinea, New Britain and Australia. In India, the butterfly occurs in South India, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Nagaland, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. O. medus is very common in grassy habitats up to an altitude of 1,600 m (5,200 ft). A shy, weak-flying insect, it stays low amongst the undergrowth, and when disturbed flies for a short distance before settling down. The butterfly basks in the sun, often with its body aligned parallel to the sun's rays. == Taxonomy == Orsotriaena medus is classified under the subfamily Satyrinae (the browns) of the brush-footed butterfly family Nymphalidae.

It belongs to the crows and tigers, that is, the Danainae group of the brush-footed butterflies family. The butterfly is also called striped tiger in India to differentiate it from the equally common plain tiger, Danaus chrysippus. == Description == The butterfly closely resembles the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) of the Americas. The wingspan is 75 to 95 mm. Both sexes of the butterfly have tawny wings with veins marked with broad black bands. The female has a pouch on the hindwing. The margins of the wings are black with two rows of white spots. The underside of the wings resembles the upperside but is paler in colouration. The male common tiger has a prominent black-and-white spot on the underside of the hindwing. In drier regions the tawny part of the hindwing pales and approaches white in colour making it very similar to the white tiger (D. melanippus). == Distribution and ecology == D. genutia is distributed throughout India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and extending to South-East Asia and Australia (except New Guinea). At least in the South Asian part of its range it is fairly common, locally very common. This butterfly occurs in scrub jungles, fallowland adjacent to habitation, dry and moist deciduous forests, preferring areas of moderate to heavy rainfall. Also occurs in degraded hill slopes and ridges, both, bare or denuded, and, those covered with secondary growth. While it is a strong flier, it never flies rapidly or high. It has stronger and faster strokes than the plain tiger. The butterfly ranges forth in search of its host and nectar plants. It visits gardens where it nectars on the flowers of Adelocaryum, Cosmos, Celosia, Lantana, Zinnia, and similar flowers. === Defence against predators, mimicry === Members of this genus are leathery, tough to kill and fake death. Since they are unpleasant to smell and taste, they are soon released by the predators, recover and fly off soon thereafter. The butterfly sequesters toxins from its food plants of the family Asclepiadaceae. The butterflies also congregate with other danaiines to sip from the sap of Crotalaria, Heliotropium and other plants which provide the pyrrolizidine alkaloids which they sequester. A study in north-eastern India showed a preference to foraging on Crotalaria juncea compared to Bauhinia purpurea, Barleria cristata rosea and Nerium oleander. To advertise their unpalatability, the butterfly has prominent markings with a striking colour pattern. The striped tiger is mimicked by both sexes of the Indian Tamil lacewing (Cethosia nietneri mahratta) and the leopard lacewing (Cethosia cyane) and females of the common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra). === Life history === This butterfly lays its egg singly under the leaves of any of its host plants of family Asclepiadaceae. The caterpillar is black and marked with bluish-white and yellow spots and lines. It has three pairs of tentacles on its body. It first eats the eggshell and then proceeds to eat leaves and vegetative parts of the plant.

Cilia of both forewings and hindwings, the antennae, head, thorax and abdomen much as in T. theophrastus. Female. Upperside very closely resembles that of female T. theophrastus, but the extent of white on the forewing is greater so that there is a greater area of white to be seen between the brown markings superposed on it, these markings have the appearance of an irregularly formed V on a white background. Hindwing much as in T. theophrastus. Underside: similar to that of its own male but the brown bands less broken, more regular. Cilia, antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male. Ethiopian region in part. N.W. Himalayas to Kumaon; the plains of Northern India; Central and Western India; Sri Lanka; Assam; Myanmar; Tenasserim in the low hot valleys of the north; extending to China and in the Malayan Subregion to Java. The description given above is taken from males and females of wet-season broods. Specimens of the dry-season broods are paler on the upperside with, in the male only anticiliary black lines to the wings. On the underside the markings on the wings will, on careful examination, be found very similar but paler brown and all very much reduced in width so that a greater extent of the white ground colour is visible. == Life history == === Food plants === Plants of the legume family, Plumbaginaceae and some of the citrus family Rutaceae.

Forewing: discoidal streak broad, anteriorly twice indented, at apex extending into base of interspace 3; posterior discal spots coalescent, forming an irregular oblique short broad band; anterior spots also coalescent, oblique from costa; a postdiscal obscure grey incurved transverse line, and a very slender, also obscure, orange transverse subterminal line. Hindwing: a subbasal transverse broad band, and a much narrower postdiscal band curved inwards at the ends; beyond this the black terminal margin is traversed by a darker black subterminal line. Underside chestnut-brown, covered with short, slender, transverse brown striae on the margin of the orange markings, which are similar to those on the upperside but broader, paler, and less clearly defined. Forewing: the pale transverse postdiscal and orange subterminal lines of the upperside replaced by a postdiscal lilacine narrow band, defined by somewhat crenulate chestnut-brown lines on each side, and a pale subterminal line. Hindwing: the base suffused with lilacine; the subbasal and postdiscal bands bordered outwardly by narrow lilacine bands, the orange-yellow of the postdiscal band much obscured by the transverse brown strife; the terminal margin with a sinuous obscure broad lilacine line. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black; beneath, the palpi and thorax greyish, abdomen ochraceous. === Dry-season form === Males and females are similar to the wet-season form, but the markings are very much broader; on the upperside of the forewing the postdiscal line generally and the subterminal line always clearly defined, the former sometimes like the latter, orange-yellow, Underside paler, the markings more blurred, the transverse short brown striae in many specimens covering nearly the whole surface of the wings. Expanse: 38\u201344 mm Race sinuata Moore (restricted to Sri Lanka) is a slightly differentiated island form. It differs constantly from the typical form in the margins of the discal markings (especially the outer margins) on the upperside of the forewing and the margins of the subbasal and postdiscal bands of the hindwing being more sinuous. == Distribution == Continental India, from the Himalayas to the Western Ghats; Assam; Burma; Tenasserim, extending into the Malayan sub-region. == Larva == Has two forms. In the first the head is large and roughly triangular, the segments of the body increase to the fourth and then diminish gradually, and the third, fourth, sixth, and twelfth have each two obtuse dorsal points. The fore part from the fourth segment is generally inclined downwards at an angle with the rest of the body and is with the underpays of a dark greenish-brown colour. The rest is just that shade of greenish-grey which the leaves assume when withered, and is crossed by diagonal dark bands exactly representing the spaces between the leaflets as a painter would paint them \u2013 a most perfect disguise. The second form of the larva differs in having the head furcate, while the dorsal points are replaced by long spine-like processes. The figure will give a better idea of the difference than any description ... The butterfly resulting from the larva with spines has a light male-mark; that resulting from the other a dark male-mark ... The two forms of larva are never found together; the smooth type of caterpillar is often found in quantities on one bush ... the smooth caterpillar feeds on Acacia and Albizzia, the spined one has never been found on any plant but Acacia.(Davidson, Bell and Aitken)","cmname": "Common Lascar","family": "Nymphalidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "drumila","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Miletographa","stname": "Allotinus Drumila","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Miletographa drumila, the crenulate darkie, is a small butterfly found in India that belongs to the lycaenids or blues family. == Description == Male upperside: earthy brown.

Race castetsi, Oberthur: The females of this remarkable form seem to be locally dimorphic. Male closely resembles the male of hyperbius but differs as follows: Upperside: ground colour a richer brighter shade of orange yellow; black markings similar but distinctly smaller, of a deeper black: subterminal transverse series of slender lunules traversing the terminal black margin on the hindwing of the same shade of orange yellow as the ground colour, not blue on the posterior half of the wing. Underside: the olivaceous brown at apex of forewing and variegating the hindwing more of a greenish golden tint. A sex-mark of specialized raised scales along middle of vein 1 on the upperside of the forewing very prominent. Female Nilgiri form: resembles the female of typical hyperbius differs as follows: Upperside: ground colour pale golden yellow; basal half of both forewings and hindwings shaded with metallic green in the forewing; in some specimens this tint is slightly olivaceous; black markings and the white oblique band on the apical area of the forewing as in hyperbius, but proportionately smaller, the purplish-blue shading along inner margin of the white band much less conspicuous, as is also the bluish tint; on the white preapical spots and subterminal markings on the forewing and on the posterior half of the subterminal line of limules on the hindwing. Underside as in hyperbius but the ground colour on the forewing a paler shade of terracotta red; the olivaceous brown variegating the hindwing of a distinctly greener tint. Female typical form as described from Trichinopoly. Similar to the male differs as follows: Upperside: ground colour pale golden yellow; basal half of the wings suffused with dark olivaceous green; black markings as in the male but larger; on the forewing the spots of the subterminal series very large, coalescent or nearly coalescent with one another and with the dentate spots on the veins in the inner terminal line; the upper two spots also of the postdiscal series very large and coalescent, the upper of the two joining on above and below to the inner postdiscal lunate spot in interspace 6, thus enclosing a prominent lunule of the ground colour. Underside as in the male but paler. == Distribution == The Himalayas, in the outer ranges from Campbellpur in the Punjab to Sikhim; Oudh; Agra; Manbhum in Bengal; Assam, the Khasi Hills; Upper Burma; extending to China and Formosa; Sumatra; Java.

Other differences are seen in the upper wing. The forewing has the discal transverse bluish-green band slightly sinuous, narrower, more curved than in P. palinurus and more distinctly decreasing in width towards the costal margin; in the female it is more sinuous than in the male. The hindwing has the transverse bluish-green band very variable in width but the inner margin is much straighter than in P. polyctor; this band that in P. polyctor stops short of vein 7, continues to the costal margin, it is however much and abruptly narrowed above vein 7; tornal ocellus claret-red with a large black centre inwardly edged with blue; the bright ochraceous subapical lunule of P. polyctor replaced by a dull whitish spot; the subterminal diffuse green lunules restricted to interspaces 2,3 and 4; the spatular apex of the tail with a small patch of bluish-green scales. On the underside of the wings the ground colour is dull pale brown to blackish brown irrorated (sprinkled) with scattered yellowish scales, which, however, on the forewing are absent from a large triangular discal patch that lies between the dorsum, the median vein, vein 5 and a line of white lunules that crosses the wing in an outward curve from the upper third of the costa to just before the tornus; these white lunules are outwardly diffuse and merge gradually into the brown ground colour. In the hindwing, the tornal ocellus much as on the upperside; an obscure ill-defined highly arched postdiscal narrow whitish band from above the tornal ocellus to the costa, ends near apex of interspace 7 in a broad white lunule; beyond this a double subterminal row of somewhat straight ochreous-white lunules in the interspaces, each lunule of the inner row bordered outwardly with blue, this bordering very faint in many specimens.

It flies high above and forages on the trees (e.g., creeper blooms on bamboo). However, occasionally it is attracted to bright flowers of plants on the ground as well (e.g., dwarf red Ixora). It flutters in a hurry while sipping nectar. It is distinguished due to its colour which is shiny fluorescent blue or green depending on the angle of observation. The magnificent colours are due to scales in interior of its wings. Also there are spots in the bottom of its hindwings similar to eyespots. The exterior of wings is brownish black with patterns similar to eyespots. Perhaps the only protection for this species is self-mimicry through the eyespots as regards to its morphology, considering its bright peacock colours and its fast flight.","cmname": "Common banded peacock Releasing excess water while mud-puddling Conservation status Not threatened","family": "Papilionidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Hasora","stname": "Hasora Badra","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Hasora badra, the common awl, is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae, which is found in India. == Description == The butterfly, which has a wingspan of 50 to 55 mm, is unmarked dark brown above.

Underside brown suffused with purple; forewing with a blackish costal patch before the apex, posterior margin yellowish; hindwing with a subbasal and submarginal suffused blackish band, the latter terminating in a black patch on anal lobe; above the patch is a purple-white streak, and within the cell a small bluish white spot. Palpi and body beneath dull yellow. Legs, pale brown. Female, above brown suffused with vinaceous yellowish brown basally; forewing with the three small subapical spots (as in male) and three rather large obliquely quadrate spots, two being disposed on the disc, the third above and within the cell. Underside with the spots on forewing as in upperside; hindwing as in male. == Range == The butterfly is found in Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Hainan, Taiwan, north Vietnam, Japan, western China, Malaysia, the Indonesian archipelago (Borneo, Sumatra, and Java), the Philippines, Palawan, the Moluccas and Sulawesi. In India the butterfly is found in South India, where it occurs in the Western Ghats, and the Nilgiris; and in the Himalayas from Mussoorie eastwards to Sikkim and through to Myanmar. It is also found in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. The type locality is Java, Indonesia. == Status == William Harry Evans (1932) described it as not rare. == Host plants == The larva has been recorded on Derris uliginosa, Milletia pachycarpa and Pongamia species. == Cited references ==","cmname": "Common awl","family": "Hesperiidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "wedah","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Pseudergolis","stname": "Pseudergolis Wedah","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "The Tabby Pseudergolis wedah is a species of Nymphalid butterfly found in Asia.

Forewing: base and costal margin irrorated (speckled) in varying degree with dusky scales; an oval annular discocellular spot that varies in size; a black, festooned, postdiscal band that extends from costa to vein 4, beyond which the veins are margined with black; this colour broadened sub-terminally into a second transverse fascia, that is followed by a very fine black line on the extreme terminal margin. In specimens from desert regions the transverse bands and the black edging to the veins are narrow, but in moister areas the two transverse bands unite posteriorly and with the slender black terminal line give an appearance as of a double series of spots of the ground colour enclosed between them. Hindwing: more uniform, the veins with terminal black spots; costa broadly pale, fading to white. Underside: pale yellowish white, in many specimens from moist localities suffused with a beautiful rosy flush; the markings in such specimens prominent, in those from dry localities more or less obsolescent. Forewing: discocellular spot as on the upperside, but complete, and not an oval ring; in some specimens a postdiscal, dark ochraceous brown, narrow, curved band from costa to middle of interspace 2. Hindwing: a small discocellular spot in the form of an oval light brown ring always much smaller than the similar spot on the forewing; a postdiscal, curved, more or less sinuate band similar to and in continuation of the band on the forewing from the costa to vein 1. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dusky black, the club of the antennae on the underside, the hairs that cover the head and thorax and the scaling of the abdomen salmon buff; beneath: much paler, fading to white in specimens from dry localities. Sex-mark: a small patch of brown specialized scales on the underside of the forewing above vein 1, closer to the base than to the termen. On the upperside this is more or less prominent as a small raised spot. Females are dimorphic. Form 1: ground colour and markings as in the male; the costa of the hindwing on the upperside concolorous with the rest of the wing; the sex-mark of course absent. Form 2. Upperside: ground colour white, often more or less irregularly suffused on parts of the wing with salmon buff; markings similar to those in the male, but very much broader. Forewing: base and costal area heavily irrorated with greyish-blue scales. Hindwing: the terminal spots at apices of the veins large and quadrate, often united into a continuous band which then encloses an anticiliary series of spots of the ground colour. In a few specimens there are traces of a postdiscal macular black band, in a very few this band is almost complete and very prominent. Underside: ground colour white; markings as in the male, but broader, darker and more prominent. It is found in Baluchistan, Sind, the Punjab, Rajasthan and Bombay. The species is also found in Asia Minor, Arabia, Persia and Afghanistan. Race tripuncta, Butler. Very closely resembles the typical from, but this the southern form or race can be distinguished as follows: Male upperside has the ground colour of a much deeper tint of salmon buff, almost orange yellow. Forewing: costa heavily irrorated with black scales; discocellular spot larger, not annular; postdiscal black fascia at all seasons united to the subterminal fascia and black anticiliary line so that the whole apex and termen of the wing are black, broadly at the costa and gradually narrowed towards the tornal angle. This black area encloses never more than three preapical moderately large spots and a complete series of minute anticiliary specks of the ground colour. Hindwing: as in C. fausta, but the terminal black spots very large. Underside: ground colour of a richer yellower tint than in the typical form; markings similar, those on the forewing dusky black, on the hindwing rose pink. Antennae, head, thorax, abdomen and sex-mark as in male of the typical form. Female upperside closely resembles the female of form 2 of C. fausta, but all the markings are darker and conspicuously broader, while the number of the preapical spots of the ground colour enclosed within the black area on the forewing is never more than three, the same as in the male. Underside, forewing: white sometimes faintly suffused with yellow; apical and terminal areas anteriorly light to dark ochraceous yellow; discocellular spot very large; transverse, postdiscal, macular dark reddish-brown band very broad. Hindwing: pale ochraceous yellow, sparsely powdered with black scales; transverse postdiscal macular band reddish brown and broad as in the forewing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in female form 2 of C. fausta.

Also their flight periods rarely overlap; in Britain the large skipper has all but finished when the silver-spotted takes to the wing in August. The silver-spotted skipper prefers warm calcareous sites and has a wide distribution as far south as North Africa, northwards throughout Europe to the Arctic and eastwards across Asia to China and Japan. It also has subspecies in North America.

The females are very fussy where they lay; most eggs in the UK are laid in short turf, up to 4 cm, and often next to patches of bare ground. This species overwinters as an egg and hatches in March. Like other skippers the larvae construct small tent-like structures from leaf blades and silk from which to feed. They enter the pupal stage after 14 to 15 weeks at the base of the foodplant. Pupation takes 10 to 14 days, and as with most butterflies the males emerge first. == Recent resurgence in the UK == Concerted conservation efforts in the UK, backed by government agencies, have seen this once-threatened species thriving in certain areas.

With a wingspan of 140\u2013190 mm, it is the largest butterfly of India. It was earlier considered a subspecies of the common birdwing (Troides helena) but is now recognised as a valid species. The species is more common in the Western Ghats, which is a biodiversity hotspot with a high degree of endemism in many taxa. It is much sought after by collectors and is a highlight of many butterfly tours in the Western Ghats. It is the state butterfly of Karnataka, India. == Description == For terms see External morphology of Lepidoptera. Description from Charles Thomas Bingham (1907) The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma, Butterflies. Volume II. Male and female. Differs from Troides helena cerberus as follows. Male: Hindwing: the black along the dorsal and terminal margins both on upper and undersides much broader; on the upperside entirely filling interspace 1, on the underside with only a narrow streak of yellow at the angle between the median vein and vein 2; the cone-shaped black markings on the terminal margin shorter and broader; on the costal margin the black is narrower than in cerberus, barely extended below vein 8 except at the base and apex of the wing where it broadens; the abdomen is dull yellow above and below not shaded with black. Female: Hindwing: the black on the costal margin as in cerberus, but there is always a large yellow spot at base of interspace 7; interspace 1 black, with a pale patch in the middle; the black terminal border broader, the inwardly extended cone-shaped markings prominent, those in interspaces 2 and 3 with pale buff lateral edgings, extended inwards to the postdiscal spots. In both male and female the hindwing on the upperside is clothed with soft, silky, long brownish-black hairs from base along the dorsal area. Expanse: 140\u2013190 mm. Habitat: Southern India. Bombay to Travancore. Larva. Roughly cylindrical, tapers a little to each end, with two rows of fleshy processes somewhat curved forwards and a double row on each side that are much shorter. On the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segments an additional long pair between the dorsal and lateral rows. Head smooth and black; body of a uniform dark madder brown, prettily lighted with a tinge of pink at the points of some of the fleshy processes; dorsal process on the 8th segment and a lateral pair on the 7th pinkish-white, with a band of the same colour uniting them. Pupa. Suspended by the tail and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae. In form stout, flattened, dilated in the middle, with head and thorax thrown back. Head somewhat angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p. 9) states- The pupa possesses the power of making a curious noise like pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; the noise is accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. I thought at first it was merely produced by the rubbing of one ring of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, it was more like the sound of a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour. Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but they speak of it as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings. == Range == Western Ghats and parts of the Eastern Ghats. == Status == The butterfly is locally very common in the southern and central Western Ghats. Also found in southern Maharashtra and northern Goa where it is uncommon. Despite its restricted range and endemicity, the butterfly is not known to be threatened but the IUCN recommends continuous monitoring. == Habitat == Found up to 3,000 feet (910 m) in the Western Ghats. Found in diverse habitats from low-land evergreen forests near the coast to mixed deciduous forests, dry scrub and agricultural fields. == Habits == Active during early morning hours when both sexes feed in the forest on Lantana and diverse food plants. Later on, it is seen sailing as high as 30 to 40 feet (9.1 to 12.2 m) over the countryside until it descends later in the evening to feed again. It flies in a leisurely manner circling around jungle clearings and also frequents hill tops. A determined flier, it is known to cover very large distances before settling. The only food source is nectar, it also visits gardens and orchards and sips from domestic plants such as Mussaenda, Ixora and Lantana. == Life cycle == Though it flies all the year round, it is abundant in the during monsoon and post-monsoon periods. === Eggs === Spherical eggs laid singly on the edges of the undersides of young leaves and shoots. === Larva === Velvety maroon red with shiny black head and four rows of fleshy bright red tubercles. Grey markings on the back with a broad oblique pink white band on the 7th and 8th segments. These are heavily parasitised by tiny braconid wasps. === Pupa === Pale brown or green, marked with fine brown striations and minute markings. Found on the underside of leaves. If touched, it sways and makes hissing sounds. == Food plants == The larval host plants of these butterflies are small creepers and climbers of the family Aristolochiaceae such as Aristolochia indica, Aristolochia tagala and Thottea siliquosa. The host plant toxins sequestered by the butterfly during its larval stage make it unpalatable to predators. Its flight and bright colouration advertise its unpalatability. == Related species == Troides minos is a member of the Troides aecus species group.

The male can be seen in the early mornings, basking on the top of leaves in forest glades and hilltops, chasing off intruders. The typical resting position of the orange-tail awl is the underside of the leaf. He does not mud-puddle or visit flowers. The female is usually found close to the host plants. == Life cycle == The larva has been recorded on Combretum latifolium and Combretum extensum in Kanara.

Forewing with pale adnervular streaks broadened along the terminal margin and extended well into the cell. Hindwing: a broad pale yellowish-white subcostal streak; interspaces 4 to 6 irrorated (sprinkled) with bluish scales; tornal angle marked with red. Underside: forewing dull black; adnervular streaks distinctly grey and much broader than on the upperside.

Antenna black; head, thorax and abdomen dark brownish black. === Female === Similar to male. Upperside: ground colour deep brownish black; adnervular streaks on forewing yellowish; irroration of blue scales on outer portions of hindwing more dense; no white subcostal streak; red patch at tornal angle large with an oval medial black spot; another similar black spot subterminally in interspace 2 posteriorly bordered by a crescent-shaped red mark. Underside similar to that in the male, differs in the adnervular streaks on the forewing that are broader and paler; on the hindwing the tornal red patch is paler and larger, and is extended broadly anteriorly and outwards towards the termen into interspace 2; in the latter it coalesces with a broad subterminal black-centred red ocellus; the irroration of blue scales in interspace 5 with a small subterminal red lunule below it. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male. === Sexual Dimorphism === Scientists have found that between male and female, there are higher amount of linalool and 2,3-butanediol present in male than in female. Male also elicits stronger odour than female does. == Range == Northern Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir, Garhwal Himalaya (Govind Wildlife Sanctuary), Sikkim, Assam, Bangladesh, Burma, southern China (including Hainan), northern Vietnam, northern Laos, Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea and Japan. == Habitat == Many species of butterfly occupy only a limited range of host plant. They utilize the plant chemicals to assess potential host plants and decide if or not to oviposit on them. Most species in the genus Papilio exclusively use rutaceous plants (rutaceae) as host plant, and Papilio protenor is a specialist. Their major host plant is citrus plants. Researches found high affinity of female towards Citrus unshiu. There are various oviposition stimulants discovered, including sugar acid, amino acid, alkaloid and flavonoid. Flavanone glycosides such as naringin and hesperidin were investigated and both elicited positive responses from the female adults. Females do not oviposit on Phellodendron amurense. The avoidance is attributed to high concentration of phellamurin. Researchers have found different adaptation to different host plants between adult females and larvae. For example, females are able to oviposit on Trollius asiaticus, but larvae fail to grow on it. Also, while the female adults are not able to oviposit on Phellodendron amurense, larvae are found to be able to live on it. Papilio protenor males appear to be more resident at their habitat than female. == Status == Common. Not threatened. == Life history == === Larva === Green, with a yellow collar and brown lichen-like markings. Feeds on Zanthoxylum alatum. (Mackinnon quoted in Bingham.) Experiments have been conducted on larvae of different instars, and it is reveiled that among all the different instars, there are significant difference of chemical composition of osmeterial secretion between 5th instar and all the previous instars. 5th larvae secretion is mainly aliphatic acid and their esters, while the previous instars contain primarily mono- and sesquiterpenoids. Scientists suspect that these differences are associated with the colouration of the 4th larval ecdysis. === Pupa === Some pupae are coloured like rough bark, others are uniformly green. (Mackinnon quoted in Bingham.) There are two colour types exist in Papilio butterflies, green and brown. Pupae that grow on green coloured branches are always green, while those that live on dead branches are brown colour. Light condition does not seem to affect this relation. The green pigment is described as a insectoverdin type, which means it is a mixture of yellow and blue chromoproteins. The chemical compounds separated from the green pupae (e.g., beta-carotene and lutein) were not found in the brown pupae; however, the bile pigment from the blue chromoprotein was found in the brown pupae, but with a lower percentage than in the green ones. Papilio species' pupal colour is determined generally by their surrounding environment. There are physical factors such as pupal width and texture, and external factors such as humidity and food. Researches indicate that There is not one major determinant, but the colouration is due to reciprocal balance of all sorts of environmental stimuli. == Cultural references == In March 1987 North Korea issued a postage stamp depicting Papilio protenor.","cmname": "Spangle Female","family": "Papilionidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "zayla","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Parasarpa","stname": "Parasarpa Zayla","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Parasarpa zayla, the bicolor commodore, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in tropical and subtropical Asia. == Cited references ==","cmname": "Bicolor commodore","family": "Nymphalidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "harisa","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Bibasis","stname": "Burara Harisa","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Bibasis harisa, the orange awlet, is a species of hesperid found in Asia.

The red Pierrots, often found perching on the Kalanchoe plant, are usually noticed due to their striking patterns and colors. == Description == The butterfly has a wingspan of 3 to 3.5 cm. The upperside of its wings are black except for a large orange portion of the lower edge of the hindwing. On the underside, the forewing is white with black spots more toward the margin. The hindwing is very striking, it is white with black spots toward the base and the margin has a wide band of orange with white spots. There is a lot of variation found in the blacks spots on the hindwings. === Technical description === Males and females. Upperside: black or brownish black, in fresh specimens in certain lights with a dull purplish flush. Fore wing: uniform, with a very slender thread-like edging of white to the costa. Hindwing: a large conspicuous orange-red patch on the posterior terminal half of the wing between the dorsum and vein 7; this patch does not extend quite to the termen but leaves a narrow edging of the black ground-colour which is produced inwards in short conical projections in interspaces 2 to 5. Cilia of both fore and hind wings chequered with black and white alternately. Underside: silvery white.

Hind wing: two spots near base, a subbasal transverse series of three spots, a medial similar series of four somewhat elongate spots and a transverse short postdiscal bar between veins 4 and 6, jet-black; terminal third of the wing above vein 7 jet-black, below that vein deep orange-red, the whole area (both the black and the red) medially traversed by a transverse curved series of round spots of the white ground-colour and margined outwardly by a series of transverse, very short and very slender lines of the same in the interspaces; anticiliary line black. Cilia of both fore and hind wings chequered as on the upperside; a short filamentous tail at apex of vein 2 black, tipped white. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, shafts of the antennae ringed with white; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen while. == Range == Himalayan foothills, North India, South India, Meghalaya, Assam, North Myanmar. == Status == They are widely distributed in peninsular India, and have been recorded from many localities in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, and Odisha. They are also found in the hilly regions of northeastern India and northern Myanmar. Studies suggest that they may be on the way to colonizing the foothills of the Himalayas due to changes in the habitat. == Habitat == They are found in semi-arid plains, degraded patches of evergreen patches, and semi-evergreen forest, gardens, hill stations and forests--in fact, wherever its food plant, Kalanchoe, is abundant. It is found from the plains up to 8000 feet. == Habits == The red Pierrot is a weak flier, and flutters about close to the ground. It flies in short bursts and settles often but not for very long. It basks with its wings half open, but prefers shade to sun, and jungle or undergrowth to open areas. It keeps on the wing almost till dark when it settles on the undersides of leaves and twigs often in company. It is sluggish early in the morning and late in the evening. It visits flowers of herbs especially of the amaranthaceae and acanthaceae family for nectar. It visits both ornamental and wild flowers and varieties of Alternanthera are among its favourite. It always sits with its wings closed to display the bright markings of its undersides. It fearlessness, weak flight and distinctive markings all indicate that it is a protected butterfly, which is peculiar considering that its host plants are not known to contain any sequestrable toxins. There is a mention in literature of the species being found at lights at night, however such phenomena are usually restricted to species that are crepuscular and this occurrence may be incidental. == Life History == It is not a common butterfly, but near its food plant, Kalanchoe, it is found in abundance and is gregarious in all its stages. === Egg === The female lays eggs on the underside of a leaf. Young and old leaves are selected without discrimination as the leaves of Kalanchoe are thick and succulent during all stages. === Caterpillar === The caterpillar is pale yellow to a dirty white, and flattened with large, jet black spiracles. The entire body is covered with tiny white setae or bristle-like hair. This caterpillar is a leaf miner by habit and this serves as its defense. As soon as it hatches it bores into the leaf and will spend the rest of its life between the epidermal layers of the leaf. Occasionally it will change leaves. The caterpillar tunnels through the entire leaf in a neat winding manner so as to make sure to consume the entire leaf. It leaves a black trail within that is filled with droppings. The caterpillar can only be seen when it is changing leaves or when it comes to the surface to pupate. Onisciform, but much rounded, and with the segments at the divisions very clearly defined; head small, almost concealed; last segment flattened. It is in colour fleshy-white, with a row of nine small black dots along the back on each side and a ring of four similar dots on the segment nearest the head; it is profusely covered with small white hairs. It feeds in the interior of the fleshy leaves of Bryophyllum calycinum, only emerging in order to turn into a pupa. === Pupa === At the time of pupation the caterpillar comes out of the leaf and weaves a silk pad and a tight body band and then moults to form the pupa. The pupa can be either on the under or upper surface of the leaf. It is yellow and covered with long light hairs. The pupa is also marked with numerous black spots all over the body. ... much resembles the larva, being short and stout and blunt and covered with short-white hair. It is of the same fleshy colour as the larva and has two lines of small black dots along the surface of the abdomen continued along the thorax. It also has a third row of four similar dots on the middle of the abdomen between them; the two dots on the thorax nearest the head are also connected by two other dots. === Food plants === The larval host plants are Kalanchoe laciniata and K. pinnata of the family Crassulaceae (stonecrop family); the latter host being a common garden plant. Adult butterflies have sometimes been seen to visit lichens. Studies suggest that they collect phenolic substances by scraping lichens.","cmname": "Red Pierrot","family": "Lycaenidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "diores","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Thaumantis","stname": "Thaumantis Diores","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Thaumantis diores, the jungle glory, is a butterfly found in South Asia that belongs to the Morphinae subfamily of the brush-footed butterflies family. == Distribution == The jungle glory ranges from Sikkim to Myanmar.

It has a habit of landing and turning around almost immediately after alighting. It repeats this turning movements as it moves along branches.

Typical male: upperside: deep purplish brown with a curious minutely granular roughened appearance; in certain lights the purple shines with iridescent blue tints. Forewings and hindwings: uniform; both with slender anticiliary black lines; on the hindwing the black spots on the tornal angle on the underside show through by transparency. Cilia brownish; filamentous tail at apex of vein 2 on the hindwing black tipped with white. Underside: brown with a slight silky lustre. Forewings and hindwings: with the following transverse, more or less broken, slender, dull whitish bands: two short bands, one on either side of the discocellulars; a discal pair, the posterior portion below vein 3 shifted inwards, thus forming the stem of a rough Y-shaped figure of which the pair of bands along the discocellulars and the anterior portion of the discal two bands may be said to form the branches; beyond these are an inner and an outer subterminal lunular line, a terminal very slender more continuous line and a jet-black anticiliary line; all these markings faint or obsolescent along the costa. Hindwing: a subbasal pair of similar, dull whitish slender bands or interrupted lines, two shorter ones, one on either side of the discocellulars, and a much curved and very much interrupted pair of discal lines, the portion of which below vein 3 is shifted inwards as on the forewing; terminal markings much as on the forewing but ending at vein 3, posterior to which in interspace 2 is a large round black spot, in interspace 1a smaller black spot, both spots crowned inwardly with ochraceous and edged outwardly with white, also both black spots are sprinkled on their outer edges with metallic blue scales. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown, a little purplish on the thorax; beneath: the palpi white mixed with black hairs that form a stiff fringe; thorax and abdomen brownish white. Typical female: upperside: dark brown, forewings and hindwings posteriorly for two-thirds of their length glossed with iridescent purplish blue. Underside: similar to that of the male, the markings more clearly defined. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male but the shafts of the antennae speckled with white. Specimens which may belong to wet-season broods differ as follows: Male upperside: ground colour darker. Underside: ground colour fuscous brown, much darker than in the typical form, the transverse white lines or bands further apart, the space enclosed between the discocellular pair and between the discal pair darker than the ground colour. On the hindwing the white lines are medially interrupted by a very broad longitudinal fuscous-black streak that extends from the base of the wing to the inner subterminal, transverse, lunular white line. Female. Does not seem to differ from the female of the typical form. Still other specimens, the difference in which may be due to locality or season (I have not been able to examine a sufficient number of dated and exactly localized specimens to make certain) seem to be intermediate between typical macrophthalma and typical kerriana Distant. These specimens differ from macrophthalma as follows: Male upperside: anticiliary black lines on both forewings and hindwings distinctly broader, more pronounced. Underside: transverse white lines on both forewings and hindwings much broader with a tendency to become diffuse and shift inwards or outwards and thus change the pattern; this is especially conspicuous on the hindwings of some of the specimens where the typical pattern is altogether confused and lost by the presence of additional short lunular white lines, and the shifting obliquely inwards or outwards of some of the lines that make up the typical pattern. There is, however, no abrupt change, intermediate specimens seem to link the most aberrant with the typical.

A variety kanarensis, Moore, has been noted to be identical in markings but always smaller. It was recorded from the Konkan and North Kanara but is most likely. == Range == Within India, the species is found in South India especially in the Western Ghats. == Habits == Their flight is slow, weak and fluttery. They glide a lot giving members of this genus the other name of paperkite. Often gliding above the tree canopy but every now and then moving lower down in forest openings. They are unpalatable like other members of the Danainae. == Food plant == The larvae are known to feed on plants of the species Aganosma cymosa (Apocynaceae). Another species of Apocynaceae, Parsonia spiralis has also been noted as a larval host plant and it is believed that many more species in the family may be discovered. == Cited references == == Other sources == Evans, W.H.

It is regarded as an occasional pest of ginger and turmeric. == Description == The Grass Demon (Udaspes folus) is a small butterfly with a wingspan of about 4 to 4.8 cm. It is black with a large white spot on the upperside of the hindwing and several smaller whites spots on the forewing. The underside of its wings is mostly white with brown edges and spots. == Range == Sri Lanka, South India to Saurashtra, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh to North East India and onto Myanmar, China, Thailand, Malaysian Peninsula, Singapore, Indonesia, Sumbawa. Australia. == Status == Not Rare in India. Rare or Very Rare in certain parts of its global range. This butterfly is seen chiefly during the monsoon, perhaps due to its larval host plants growing at this time of the year. == Habitat == The Grass Demon is to be found in deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. It prefers the edges of open spaces rather than the deep forest shade or open sunlight. It is most abundant in the more open regions of hilly jungle. It is also encountered on the plains at some distance from such terrain. It occurs up to 8000 feet in the hills of South India and up to 5000 feet in the Himalayas. == Habits == The Grass Demon prefers forest edges or clearings where dappled light is present. Its black and white colouration may have evolved to take advantage of the dappled light in these areas. The pied pattern which seems prominent in the open is effectively disruptive in the shade and the butterfly is difficult to locate once it settles down. It is a bold insect and not easily disturbed. It usually flies in the shade among bushes and under trees keeping low and close to the ground. From time to time, it takes short flights, and, occasionally, much longer excursions into the open clearings. Its flight is quick and the path is very erratic making it very difficult to track when in flight. When basking it sits on the upperside of leaves of herbs or bushes with its hindwings pressed flat against the surface and its forewings held half open at an angle above the hindwings. This butterfly also has a unique wing flashing display most often seen just after it has alighted on a leaf. It will move its hindwings down toward the leaf surface. When the hindwings are about halfway down the forewings also start moving downwards. On the upward beat both wings are moved simultaneously till the hindwings come together. Then it again begins the downward beat. Each beat is performed very slowly and the butterfly is very conspicuous during this time. This display is unique since no other peninsular Indian butterfly is known to display the capability of moving forewings and hindwings separately. The Grass Demon is a nectar lover and has a long proboscis compared to body size. This makes it easy to get to nectar of flowers with long corolla tubes. In gardens, the Common Periwinkle (Vinca rosea) and Lantana are its favourite flowers. It rarely visits bird or dung droppings. It is fond of water and often seen perched on a stone in a stream-bed. == Life cycle == The butterflies emerge in February or March and lay eggs before they die. The eggs remain dormant till the rains, that is, usually the month of May, when they hatch. The caterpillars pupate in September\u2013October and the adults emerge four to six months later. In some cases the caterpillars pupate later and in these cases the pupa remain dormant, throughout the dry season, till May when the rains begin. === Eggs === The female normally sits on the underside of the leaf of the host plant and lays a single egg. The egg is reddish and appears smooth and dome shaped. When about to hatch it turns white with a red top. === Larva === Soon after hatching, the caterpillar does not consume the eggshell completely and it makes itself a spacious cell and hides inside it. The caterpillar is sluggish and comes out to feed only at night. Even when disturbed it is reluctant to leave its cell. The caterpillar is a light uniform leaf green color with a dark green pulsating line on the back and a relatively small, dark head. The full grown larva has the habit of resting with the first three segments contracted, so as to give a humped appearance. It always lies closely applied to the leaf, by turning over a triangular piece from the edge onto the upper surface over itself. Specific host plants include Zingiber zerumbet. === Pupa === Pupation takes place on the same plant within a cell. The pupa is long and cylindrical, watery green in colour. It has a long conical projection in front of the head. The eyes are easily seen but do not protrude out of the outline of the pupa. The pupa broadens towards the shoulders and the abdomen gradually tapers to the last segment. The most striking characteristic of the pupa is its proboscis. It is long and thin generally extending up to and a little beyond the tip of the abdomen. The pupa is the same color of the caterpillar and unmarked. It is covered in a thin layer of white powder. The body band is neither too tight nor too loose and allows the pupa to wriggle if disturbed. == Food plants == The Grass Demon feeds on ginger, turmeric, and their relatives Curcuma aromatica, Curcuma decipiens, Hedychium sp. and other plants of Family Sctiaminae.

The cilia is short, black, alternated with pale buffy white in the middle of the interspaces. Hindwing: the abdominal fold, the apical half obliquely of interspace 1, the termen broadly, the base of the cell and the costal area up to and including the basal half of interspace 7 velvety black, the rest of the wing rich silky yellow; the veins prominently but narrowly black; the inner margin of the terminal black border produced inwards into prominent cone-shaped markings in the interspaces. All specimens have one or more postdiscal black spots in the interspaces, but never a complete series; in interspace 2 and sometimes also in interspace 3 these spots coalesce with the cone-shaped projections of the terminal black border. Underneath the abdominal fold is a dense mass of buffy-white scented cottony pubescence. Underside similar, the adnervular pale streaks on the forewing broader and more prominent. Hindwing: dorsal margin broadly black, with an edging of long soft black hairs; interspace 1 with a large oval postdiscal and a terminal black spot; interspace 2 with the postdiscal black spot generally separate from the cone-shaped projection of the black terminal border; the apical and lateral margins of interspaces 2-6 pale yellow irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales. Antenna, head and thorax black, the collar narrowly crimson; abdomen yellow, shaded above with black; beneath: the thorax with a large lateral patch of crimson, the anal segment prominently buff coloured. Female Upper and under sides of the female is similar to those in the male, but with the following differences: Forewing: the adnervular pale streaks broader and more prominent. Hindwing: the black at base and along the costal margin broader, occupying fully one-third of the cell, the area above it and above vein 7, interrupted however, in interspace 7 near the apex of wing, by a transverse yellow mark which is sometimes subobsolete; a postdiscal series of large oval black spots, those in interspaces 2 and 3 often joined on the upperside to the cone-shaped terminal black marks; dorsal margin also more broadly black, without the fringe of black hairs and or course of the abdominal fold.

In many specimens there is a diffuse fuscous spot between the discal pair of transverse fine lines on forewing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen above black, thorax and abdomen with lateral greyish longitudinal stripes: beneath white. Body of the female paler than that of the male. Race andamanica, very closely resembles the typical form; the dark markings, however, are as a rule heavier and more pronounced, but in this some specimens from the Anaimalai Hills approximate very closely to the lighter coloured Andaman individuals. One constant point of difference, however, seems to be the large amount of rich ochraceous colour on the upperside of the hindwing posteriorly. The costal margin and the postdiscal series of rings on the forewing are also strongly tinged with ochraceous. Apparently common at Port Blair. Expanse 58\u201370 mm. === Larva === Mr. Bell noticed a female on the 10th October depositing its eggs on the tenderest leaves and buds of a banian tree and secured six, of which two were reared. The eggs were curious and beautiful, high domed-shaped or almost conical, with an aperture at the top fitted with a deeply dentate flat cap like a cogged wheel. The larva escaped by raising this and did not eat the shell. The larva was unlike any other that, we have ever seen, slender, cylindrical and smooth; with two long curved divergent filaments or soft horns on the head, a single at outer sword-shaped one on the back at the 5th or 6th segment curved backwards and serrated on its inner edge, and another on the last segment curved forwards and serrated on its outer edge. The colour was a fine reddish brown with a broad green band on the side from the 5th to the last segment. === Pupa === Suspended by the tail, very much compressed, with a dorsal ridge from head to tail, high and obtusely pointed in the middle, the palpi-cases united and produced into a long somewhat recurved snout; colour brown with fine dark striae. (Davidson & Aitken) == Habits == It has been recorded as a migrant in southern India and is known to mud-puddle. == Distribution == Continental India generally, from the Himalayas to Travancore, in the hills, avoiding the hot dry plains of northern and central India; Assam; Manipur; Burma; Tenasserim; Kumaun Himalaya extending to China and Japan.

The forewing has a postdiscal band composed of internervular broad blue streaks gradually shortened and obsolescent anteriorly, not extended beyond interspace 6. The hindwing has the terminal three-fourths beyond a line crossing the apical third of the cell pale blue, or greyish blue, with superposed postdiscal, subterminal and terminal series of black spots\u2014the postdiscal spots elongate, inwardly conical; the subterminal oval, placed in the interspaces, the terminal irregular, placed along the apices of the veins and anteriorly coalescing more or less with the subterminal spots. The underside is black with and on the base of the cell in the forewing is an elongate spot of dark red; the postdiscal transverse series of streaks as on the upperside but grey tinged with ochraceous and extended right up to the costa; in some specimens similar but narrow streaks also in the cell. Hindwing with five irregular small patches of red at base, the outer three-fourths of the wing grey touched with ochraceous, but generally narrower than the blue on the upperside; the inner margin of the grey area crosses the wing beyond the cell; the postdiscal and subterminal black spots as on the upperside. In some specimens this grey area is greatly restricted, its inner margin crossing the wing well beyond the apex of the cell; the subterminal spots merged completely with the terminal spots and form a comparatively broad terminal black band. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen blackish brown. Female is very similar but the internervular streaks on the forewing paler, extended into the cell both on the upper and undersides. Hindwing: the pale blue area on the upperside and the corresponding grey area on the underside paler. In some specimens there is a diffuse short crimson streak at the base of the cell of the forewing on the upperside. == Distribution == This species is endemic to India and Sri Lanka. In India it is restricted to the Western Ghats, Southern India and the east coast. It has been recorded as far north as Gujarat. It is often seen even in the gardens and sometimes in the middle of busy traffic in large cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore. Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth recorded it in Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Sikkim. == Status == It is common and not thought to be threatened. It occurs throughout the year but more common in the monsoon and immediately after it. In Sri Lanka, populations of Papilio polymnestor have expanded due to the increased availability of its food plants (family Rutaceae) due to modification of landscapes. == As a symbol == It is the state butterfly of the state of Maharashtra, India. == Habitat == The butterfly is most common in heavy rainfall areas, such as evergreen forests. It is also common in deciduous forests and wooded urban areas, primarily due to the cultivation of its host plants, i.e. the Citrus species. == Habits == This butterfly frequents forest paths and streams. The male is fond of sun and avoids the shade. It frequents flowers especially of Mussaenda frondosa, Ixora coccinea, Jasminum species and Asystasia gangetica. Periodically raids thicker forest patches, especially where Atalantia species are to be found in search of females to mate with. Has a rapid unidirectional flight and frequently changes course, hopping up and down in its flight path. Difficult to catch. Known to bask in the sun. Attracted to damp patch and has greater tolerance to other butterflies and humans while lapping up the mineral rich moisture. Known to visit animal droppings. The blue Mormon has been recorded as a pollinator of cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum). It is known to mud-puddle. == Life cycle == === Eggs === The eggs are laid singly on the upper surfaces of the leaves on rutaceous plants at ten feet or so above the ground. The newly laid egg is spherical and light green but darkens over time to orange yellow. === Caterpillar === The newborn caterpillar makes the eggshell its first meal and then rests on a silken bed that it spins for itself near the edge of a leaf. The little caterpillar mimics a bird dropping with its olive green body and white uric acid-like markings. The sheen enhances its resemblance to fresh bird dropping. While small in size, this camouflage permits the caterpillar to rest on the centre of a leaf and nibble around the edges. Later its growing size forces it to keep to twigs and the undersides of leaves except when it is feeding on leaves. It moves slowly and haltingly. It has a unique habit of securing its balance by weaving silk on the substratum. The caterpillar can be distinguished from the common Mormon, which it resembles, by its larger size, greenish head and a blue streak in the eyespot in segments 4 to 5. It has a deep red osmeterium. === Pupa === The pupa also resembles that of the common Mormon but is much larger and can be easily distinguished by the prominent folds on the lower side of the abdominal protrusion. == Food plants == The larva have been recorded to feed on small rutaceous forest trees and large shrubs. The list of host plants includes: Atalantia racemosa and Atalantia wightii Glycosmis arborea Paramigyna monophylla Citrus grandis Citrus limon Other Citrus cultivars.","cmname": "Blue Mormon","family": "Papilionidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "armandii","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Neope","stname": "Neope Armandii","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Neope armandii is a species of satyrine butterfly found in Asia. == Subspecies == Neope armandii armandii (western China, Assam, Burma) Neope armandii fusca Leech, 1891 Neope armandii khasiana Moore, 1881 (Assam to Myanmar, northern Thailand, Vietnam, Yunnan)","cmname": "Neope armandii","tribe": "Elymniini","family": "Nymphalidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "ananda","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Tarucus","stname": "Tarucus Ananda","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Tarucus ananda, the dark Pierrot, is a small butterfly found in India that belongs to the lycaenids or blues family.

It belongs to the family of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It ranges from Sri Lanka and South India to Bengal, and from Kumaon to Assam in India onto Myanmar. The butterfly is also found in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is usually not a rare species, but may be less common, even rare, in parts of its range. == Description == This butterfly resembles the Quaker (Neopithecops zalmora), especially in flight. The female Malayan has a broader and more rounded forewing than the male. Wet-season form: Upperside: from dull somewhat pale brown to dark brown, some specimens nearly uniform, others with a more or less distinct pale discal patch on the forewing. Hindwing: uniform; a slender short filamentous tail at apex of vein 1, very often absent. Underside: white. Forewing: with the following brown markings: a spot in cell, a transverse short line on the discocellulars, a postdiscal curved series of transverse spots or very short bars that cross the wing from costa to dorsum and are in irregular echelon one with the other, followed by a slender transverse broken line, a subterminal series of broader transverse spots and an anticiliary slender line; at apex of wing the markings are diffuse and form a very small brown-shaded patch, while further inwards along the costa veins 10, 11 and 12 terminate in a minute brown dot. Hindwing: three spots near base in transverse order, a large, conspicuous, rounded, subcostal and a smaller similar spot near the middle of the dorsum, black; between the latter two and also along the discocellulars are some irregular much paler brown transverse spots on the disc, which are followed as on the forewing by an outer postdiscal, very slender brown line, a subterminal series of brown or black spots, and a black anticiliary line. Cilia of forewings and hindwings white, turning to dark brown at apex of forewing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown, the antenna ringed narrowly with white; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen snow-white, the third, slender acicular joint of the palpi conspicuously brown. Dry-season brood: Very similar to the wet-season brood, but the forewing on the upperside bears a large, oval, obliquely-placed conical patch that extends from the middle of the dorsal margin to vein 4. In certain specimens this white bar or patch is continued on to the hindwing. Underside: similar to that of the wet-season form but all the markings broader, coarser, more prominent. Forewing: costa and apex in some specimens broadly shaded with diffuse fuscous brown; the outer postdiscal brown line formed into a series of lunules that extend outwards slenderly along the veins and join the anticiliary brown line, thus enclosing in the interspaces a series of spots of the white ground colour, each of which is centred with a black or dark brown subtriangular spot. Hindwing: the terminal markings modified as on the forewing; the spot in interspace 3 of the subterminal series larger and more prominent than the others, the large subcostal black spot often broken by an anterior and a posterior silvery spot superposed on it. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in specimens of the wet-season brood but slightly darker above. Subspecies include: Megisba malaya presbyter Fruhstorfer - Central and South Nicobars. Rare. Validity requires confirmation. Megisba malaya sikkima Moore - Kumaon to Myanmar. Andamans. Not rare. Tailed. Megisba malaya thwaitesi Moore - Sri Lanka, South India to Bengal. Not rare. Tailless. The tailed and tailless subspecies are sympatric in Sikkim, the tailed one is more commonly found at lower altitudes. == Ecology and life history == The Malayan is a butterfly of evergreen forests. Its caterpillar is light green, vermiform, the middle segments swollen; it feeds on Allophyllus cobbe (Sapindaceae). The pupa is thick, with blunted ends. Adults fly low, close to the ground. This species is often seen in forest glades and forest edges. The males frequent cow dung and damp patches for mud-puddling, but at least on Borneo and probably elsewhere too not generally carrion or old fruit. == Footnotes ==","cmname": "Malayan","family": "Lycaenidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "honorei","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Thoressa","stname": "Thoressa Honorei","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Thoressa honorei, commonly known as the Madras ace, is a skipper butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae.","cmname": "Madras ace","family": "Hesperiidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "thais","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Cirrochroa","stname": "Cirrochroa Thais","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Cirrochroa thais, the Tamil yeoman, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in forested areas of tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. == Description == Wingspan 60-75 mm.","cmname": "Tamil yeoman Upperside Underside","family": "Nymphalidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "vikasi","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Neptis","stname": "Neptis Pseudovikasi","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Neptis vikasi, the dingy sailer, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in Asia, from north-eastern India to Burma and northern Indochina.","cmname": "Neptis vikasi Neptis vikasi pseudovikasi","family": "Nymphalidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "aidoneus","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Atrophaneura","stname": "Atrophaneura Aidoneus","class": "Insecta","subgenus": "Atrophaneura","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Atrophaneura aidoneus, the lesser batwing, is an Asian species of butterfly that belongs to the batwings group of Atrophaneura, comprising tailless black swallowtail butterflies. == Description == Wingspan: 112-162 mm.

The forewing has the cell crossed by five short black bands, of which the basal extends to the dorsum, the sub-basal into interspace 1, the medial and pre-apical up to the median vein, and the apical or fifth along the discocellulars; this last band extends broadly on both sides of the veinlets and terminates at the lower apex of the cell; beyond these are broad postdiscal and terminal black transverse bands from costa to tornal angle; the two bands coalesce below vein 4 and terminate in a point at the tornus; the white portions of the cell anteriorly overlaid with pale green; short broken glossy green bands between the black cellular apical band and the discal band and anteriorly between the latter and the terminal band. The upperside of the hindwing has the basal three-fourths uniformly white, with black markings on the underside that show through; the terminal fourth dark grey traversed by a curved irregular subterminal series of black crescent shaped marks that ends in a black tornal spot and a terminal black band that follows the indentations of the wing; the emargination (notches in a margin) below the black tornal spot are edged with ochraceous; the tail blackish grey, edged and tipped with white. The underside of the forewing is similar to the upperside in markings but the green shading over the white portions in the basal half of the cell more decided; the discal and terminal transverse black bands are separate, and are not joined posteriorly, the former edged posteriorly on both sides by dark grey due to the black on the upperside that shows through by transparency. The underside of the hindwing is half green on the basal part while the outer half white; a large black tornal spot; a black line along the dorsum that curves above the tornal spot outwards to vein 2; a straight subbasal black band from costa across cell that terminates on vein 2, where it joins the dorsal black line; a broader black band from costa across apex of cell extended into base of interspace 3; an irregular discal series of black markings curved inwards posteriorly towards the tornal spot; a subterminal series of very small slender black lunules in pairs, the ground colour on the inner side of these darkened to rich ochreous yellow; lastly, a series of short terminal black bars in the interspaces so arranged as to follow indentations of the termen; tail dusky black edged with white. Antenna black; head and thorax anteriorly with a broad black medial band, rest of thorax bluish; abdomen white, marked beneath on each side by a black stripe. Race alcibiades, Fabr. is the most widely spread race of antiphates, from which it differs as follows: Upperside of males and females, all the black markings shorter and narrower. Forewing: the discal and terminal bands separate, the former rarely extended below vein 3, the latter in no specimen reaches the dorsal margin. Hindwing: the broad grey area on the terminal margin reduced to a small patch of grey at the apices of interspaces 2 to 4; the subterminal black markings rarely present anteriorly, generally confined to the limits of the grey patch. Underside: the extent of the black markings similarly reduced, otherwise as in the typical form. The width and length of the transverse black markings on the upperside of the forewing, also the extent of the grey terminal area and the presence or absence of the black subterminal markings on the upperside of the hindwing, are all very variable. Form nebulosus, Butler, is a melanistic variety recorded from Sikkim. Var. continentalis, Eimer, has the caudal area of the hindwing on the upperside suffused with black. Var. itamputi, Butler, has the postdiscal and terminal black bands on the upperside of the forewing united posteriorly, but neither band extends up to the tornus.

Forewing: a broad streak in cell, two more or less confluent streaks obscurely divided by a diffuse blackish line below it in interspace 1, followed by an upper discal series of five short lines in interspaces 3, 4, 5 and 10, and a subterminal complete series of elongate narrow spots; both the discal and subterminal series are curved inwards anteriorly. In most specimens the streaks in interspace 1 and in cell are irrorated with black scales. Hindwing: a broad streak along the dorsum divided by vein 1a, two narrow long streaks in interspace 1, a much broader elongated oval streak in cell, with another elongate broad streak above it in interspace 7, a discal series of five narrow elongate spots apex of cell, followed by a complete subterminal series of more or less oval spots. Underside: ground colour and markings similar, more clearly defined, and on the forewing generally broader and whiter, except that the anterior one or two streaks or spots of the discal and subterminal series, like all the markings on the hindwing, are strongly suffused with bright yellow; in addition the precostal area on the hindwing is bright chrome yellow.

In fact, the insect may be described as white both on the upper and under sides, the veins broadly bordered with black, and with black terminal margins formed by the expansion and coalescence of the black at the apices of the veins; discoidal cell of the forewing with a large patch of black at the apex. The black along the veins of both forewing and hindwing suddenly broadened on the discal area; on the underside of the hindwing they almost form a connected discal, transverse black band; the chrome-yellow spot on the precostal area as in A. agathon. Antennae black, head and thorax dusky grey, abdomen white; beneath: head and thorax blackish, abdomen white.

Although one of the blues, both sexes are brown on the uppersides with a band of orange spots at the border of each wing. They can be mistaken for other female blues but the brown argus never has any blue scales at the base of the wings like other female blues often do. It could also be mistaken for the northern brown argus (Aricia artaxerxes) were it not for the fact that their ranges do not overlap in the UK, unlike on continental Europe. The underside has the typical blue pattern of a greyish/brownish ground colour with black spots outlined in white and a row of orange spots along the border. The pattern of the black spots is the best way to distinguish this species from female common, chalkhill and Adonis blues as they lack the black spot found near the base of the forewing which is present on these three species. This species has seen an expansion in its range in recent years and is widely distributed across south-east England and most of the Midlands with colonies occurring in Wales and as far north as Yorkshire. These northern sites have seen a lot of confusion in recent years with genetic studies looking at various colonies to separate the two Aricia species. Until a few years ago, these northern colonies were thought to be the northern brown argus and more colonies may yet be found to be misidentified. Like other blues it is common on the chalk downlands of southern England but will also use other habitats such as woodland clearings, coastal grasslands and heathland. It is not closely related to the Scotch argus. == Life cycle and food plants == Note that information on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not be consistent with the species in other parts of its range. Common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium) is the favoured food plant on calcareous soils. In other habitats dove's-foot cranesbill (Geranium molle) and common stork's-bill (Erodium cicutarium) are used and possibly other Geranium species as well. Eggs are laid singly on the underside of leaves. The typically slug-like lycid larvae are green with a pale line along each side and always attended by ants. They hibernate as fully-grown larvae and pupate the following spring. There are two broods a year in the southern colonies with adults on the wing in May and June and again in late July till mid-September but further north they are single brooded and fly in June and July.","cmname": "Brown argus Male, dorsal Male, ventral both at Aston Rowant NNR, Oxfordshire","family": "Lycaenidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "sita","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Parantica","stname": "Parantica Sita","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Parantica sita, the chestnut tiger, is a butterfly found in Asia that belongs to the crows and tigers, that is, the danaid group of the brush-footed butterflies family. == Description == Wings elongate, almost as in Idea.

It is widely distributed, being found from India, the Himalayas, Southeast Asia, to Australia. It contains twenty-four recognized subspecies. == Life cycle and ecology == The eggs are laid on the upper surface of young leaves. They hatch in about six days, whereupon they will construct a leaf shelter by cutting the edge of a leaf, folding a triangular piece back, and then attaching it with silk. During the day, they hide under this shelter and only emerge at night to feed. The larvae feed on leaves of vines belonging to the genus Dioscorea; including Dioscorea transversa, Dioscorea alata, and Dioscorea numularia. They may make other shelters as they grow larger. After about 23 days, they pupate inside their final shelter, emerging as adults after 10 days. The adults are quick flyers, maintaining a height relatively close to ground. They are usually encountered resting underneath leaf surfaces. They feed on nectar from flowers during the morning. Mating is not seasonal and adults emerge all throughout the year. However, the population is greatest during the wet season. == Distribution and habitat == Tagiades japetus have a wide range of occurrence. They are found from Sri Lanka and India to the Himalayas, and Indochina. They also occur throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia to the Philippines and down to Papua New Guinea and the surrounding islands, and northeastern Australia.

The Common Jezebel is one of the most common of the approximately 225 described species in the genus Delias. == Description == The wingspan of both males and females ranges from 6.5 to 8.5 cm. === Male === Upperside is white. The forewings have the veins broadly black, this colour broadened triangularly at the termination of the veins, costal margin narrowly black; a broad black postdiscal transverse band from costa to dorsum sloped obliquely outwards from costa to vein 4, thence parallel to termen. Hindwing with the veins similar but for three-fourths of their length much more narrowly black; a postdiscal transverse black band as on the forewing but much narrower, curved and extended only between veins 2 and 6; beyond this the veins are more broadly black and this colour as on the forewing broadens out triangularly at the termination of the veins; the interspaces beyond the postdiscal black band pink, due to the vermilion colouration of the underside showing through. On the underside, the forewings are similar but the black edging to the veins much broader, the upper two interspaces beyond the postdiscal transverse band tinged with yellow. Hindwing: ground colour bright yellow, the veins and transverse postdiscal band as on the upperside but much more broadly black, the latter extended from the costa to vein 2; the interspaces between the veins beyond the postdiscal fascia with a series of broadly lanceolate (lance-shaped) or cone-shaped vermilion-red spots, each spot very narrowly edged with white; the basal portion of interspace 6 white, in contrast to the bright yellow of the ground colour. Antenna black; head, thorax and abdomen white, the apical joint of the palpi black; the head and thorax with a mixture of black hairs that give these parts a grey-blue appearance. === Female === Upper and undersides similar to those in the male, but the black edging to the veins and the postdiscal transverse bands on both forewings and hindwings are much broader. == Range and habits == The common Jezebel are nomadic in behaviour and are found in a variety of environment including, but not limited to, temperate hill forests, tropical rainforests, dry open woodlands, and beach hinterlands. They are generally found all over India, except in the desert tracts, and up to an altitude of 7,000 feet (2,100 m) in the hills. The butterfly may be found wherever there are trees, even in towns and cities, flying high among the trees and visiting flowers. It is also commonly seen in gardens. The females can be seen flying amongst the trees in search of its food plants, while the males are more frequently observed visiting flowers for nectar or mud-puddling. It rests with its wings closed exhibiting the brilliantly coloured underside. The Jezebel often flies high up in the canopy and usually comes lower down only to feed on nectar in flowers. Due to this habit apparently, it has evolved a dull upperside and a brilliant underside so that birds below it recognise it immediately while in flight and at rest. == Protection == It has bright colouration to indicate the fact that it is unpalatable due to toxins accumulated by the larvae from the host plants. Like other unpalatable butterflies the common Jezebel is mimicked by Prioneris sita, the painted sawtooth. The common Jezebel can be distinguished by the shape of the orange red spots on the hindwing. In the painted sawtooth these spots are very squarish whereas in the common Jezebel they are more arrow head shaped. The painted sawtooth also flies faster and will also mudpuddle. == Life cycle == The Jezebel breeds all year round. === Eggs === Eggs are laid in batches of about 10 or 20 in number although larger batch sizes are not unheard of. These are laid on the underside of a leaf of its food plant. === Larva === The caterpillars are gregarious in the first few instars. Caterpillars are yellow brown with a black head and have white tubercules from which long white hair arise. Long, cylindrical and smooth with an oily gloss. Two subdorsal rows of long white bristles springing from minute white tubercles; head, sides and back sparsely clothed with short white bristles: colour brown, head and feet black. It may be found from the beginning of August everywhere on the common 'mistletoe' (Loranthus), from which it will drop and hang by a thread if the tree is shaken. We have never found it feeding on anything else. Unlike most butterflies this species lays as many as twenty or thirty eggs on one leaf, in parallel rows, with equal intervals, and the larvae continue in some measure gregarious to the last, so that a large number of pupae are often found, at a little distance from each other, on a wall, or the trunk of a tree. When born, they first make a meal of their eggshell and wander off to the nearest leaf-margin where they devour the leaf, side by side, and then move on to the next one. Leaf after leaf is collectively devoured by this group till they pass through the first few instars of the larval stage. However growth amongst these caterpillars is not even due to the varying amount of food that each is able to get. Accordingly their development is staggered, they pupate only when they are ready and the brood emerges over a period of time. The larva is not very lively. When disturbed, it drops off the leaf by a silken thread. === Pupa === Closely attached by the tail and by a band generally to a vertical surface with the head upwards. It is moderately stout with a short snout, two small tubercles on the head, a sharp but not prominent dorsal ridge on the thorax, continued in a row of tubercles on the abdominal segments. Below these are two partial subdorsal rows. Colour bright yellow; tubercles and a row of spots defining the wing-cases black. Large numbers are destroyed by a dipterous parasite very like a common house-fly. (Davidson and Aitken) The chrysalis is bright yellow coloured. It is marked with black spots and lines. It is attached to the underside of a leaf or branch or any other suitable surface by a strong tail pad and a tight body band. == Food plants == The host plants are various species of small shrubs which are plant parasites growing on branches of trees such as Loranthus.

Earlier considered a subspecies of the banded swallowtail (Papilio demolion) of Southeast Asia, it is now considered a distinct species. == DescriptionEdit == It is similar to Papilio demolion but distinguishable chiefly by the pale greenish-yellow band that crosses the wings starting from the middle and not from just before the middle of the dorsal margin of the hindwing, also this band is composed entirely of separate spots on the forewing. == RangeEdit == Western Ghats and hills of southern India. It is common (May to August) in Thenmala, Kollam district, south Kerala. == StatusEdit == The IUCN Red Data Book records the Malabar banded swallowtail as uncommon and not threatened as a species. However a survey in the early 1990s by Harish Gaonkar showed the butterfly to be rare but distributed from Kerala to Goa. The butterfly was considered to be common in Karwar in the past. It is not to be found in Maharashtra and Gujarat. It is protected by law in India. == HabitatEdit == Generally found in the semi-evergreen and evergreen tropical forests of the Western Ghats where it flies mainly during the monsoon months. == HabitsEdit == The males are fond of heavy jungle especially on hilltops. The females fly lower in even thicker jungle. The butterflies visit flowers such as Lantana, Stachytarpheta and Clerodendrum. == Life cycleEdit == There are two to three broods a year. Recorded in Kodagu (Coorg) as having broods from September to October, November to December, and, from April to May. Recorded in Karnataka in July and in September. Males appear to outnumber the females. The life-history of this insect is given by Messrs. Davidson and Aitken: One of these gentlemen watched a female, P. liomedon, laying its eggs on a tender shoot of a small jungle tree or shrub (Acronychia laurifolia). There were ten eggs, laid one on top of the other. Of the caterpillars which emerged five days after the eggs were laid, five passed successfully through all dangers and became beautiful specimens, one female and four males. (This is one of the butterflies of which we rarely find females.) All through their lives these larvae continued gregarious, dispersing occasionally to feed, but always returning to rest side by side on the upper surface of a leaf. The following dates may be interesting. Eggs laid 2 August, hatched 7 August; skins cast (and eaten) 12 August; again 17 August; again 20 to 22 August. The most advanced cast its skin again on the 28th August, became a pupa on the 2nd of September, and emerged on the 15th of September. The others followed within two days. At first the larvae were of an oily yellow colour and bore many pairs of spiny points, but these disappeared with age and after the last moult there were only the short fleshy processes on the 2nd and last segment which characterise the group, and one additional curved pair on the ninth segment. The colour after the last moult was a clear slaty-blue, changing eventually to a greenish tint, with light brown markings very much the same as those which characterise the rest of the group. The pupa was more abruptly bent back from the middle of the thorax than that of P. erithonius (i. e. P. demoleus) and adorned on the thorax with a sword-shaped horn, fully three-eighths of an inch long, and always bent either to the right or the left. The colour was brown or green and yellow according to situation. === EggsEdit === The female lays her eggs one over the other in a stick of ten to sixteen. The orange eggs gradually fade to yellow. The pale black of the larval heads appear on the upperside of the eggs on the fourth day. The eggs hatch on the fifth day. === LarvaEdit === The larvae live gregariously and are heavily parasitized (up to 90%). The first instar lasts about five days, second instar for four days, third instar five, fourth instar four, about three days for the fifth instar and another three days for the sixth instar. They begin to pupate after around 22 days of their larval duration. == PupaEdit == The lower portion of the pupa is yellow or fluorescent green with purple lines. Between the head and the thorax region a projection like a jug-handle is seen. This is distinctive of the species. Below the thoracic region, two yellow spots are seen. The pupal duration is about 15 days. == Food plantsEdit == Acronychia laurifolia and Evodia roxburghiana of the family Rutaceae. == Cited referencesEdit == == Other referencesEdit == Evans, W.H.

They inhabit certain small localities and are always to be found there. == Habits == While the male swordtails are rarely away from their favourite spots, the females wander abroad in search of their host plants, the laurels. The males generally fly high up, often around a selected tree, where they can be seen settling now and then well out of reach. Occasionally, they descend close to the ground where they can be netted. The females, being less lively, fly closer to the ground, and are often found settling on their host plants. == Life cycle == This species is single brooded. It regularly emerges in Himachal Pradesh area in mid-April and stays on the wing till mid-May. The brood emerges slightly earlier east of Himachal till in Assam the butterflies appear as early as January. Usually, the females emerge much later than the males and it is not uncommon to see fresh females with wings in perfect condition being courted by males with tattered wings. === Caterpillar === The caterpillars are greenish and have black dots.

The species has a high degree of sexual dimorphism. The female is mimetic with multiple morphs. ==== Male ==== The upper side of the wings is jet black, offset with three pairs of white spots, two on the forewing and one on the hind. These spots are surrounded by purple iridescence. In addition, the upper side of the hindwing bears a series of small white dots. ==== Female ==== The upper side of the wings of the female is a brownish black and does not have any spots like those of the male. The edges bear white markings which are similar to those of the Common Indian Crow. == Distribution == H. bolina is found in Madagascar in the west, through to South and Southeast Asia, South Pacific islands (French Polynesia, Tonga, Tuvalu, Samoa, Vanuatu), and occurs in parts of Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. == Habitat == H. bolina is a fairly common butterfly found in lightly wooded country, deciduous forests, thick and moist scrub, and the greener parts of human habitats. == Mimicry == To the west the female is monomorphic, mimicking species of the oriental and Australasian danaid genus Euploea. Eastwards H. bolina is frequently polymorphic and most forms are then non-mimetic. In areas where it resembles Euploea the butterfly has usually been designated a Batesian mimic. == Life cycle and ecology == H. bolina is known for maternal care, with the females guarding leaves where eggs have been laid. Males are also very territorial and site fidelity increases with age. Territories that enhance the detection of females are preferred. The female hovers over a plant to check for ants which will eat her eggs. After selecting a plant which has no ants on it, she lays at least one but often two to five eggs on the undersides of the leaves. === Host plants === Race bolina breeds on Sida rhombifolia, Elatostemma cuneatum, Portulaca oleracea, Laportea interrupta, Triumfetta pentandra, and Asystasia species. Other hosts include Elatostema cuneatum, Fleurya interrupta, Pseuderanthemum variabile, and Synedrella nodiflora. They are also known to feed on Urtica dioica and Malva spp. === Eggs === The eggs are a pale, glassy green with longitudinal ridges except on the top. === Caterpillar === After about four days the eggs hatch. The caterpillars immediately disperse. They are black with an orange head. The last segment is also orange. The head bears a pair of long branched black horns. The body surface is also covered with long, branched, orangish black spines. These spines look whitish and transparent immediately after moulting, but soon become the usual orange. In later instars the spiracles are surrounded by thin, dirty orange rings. Infection by Wolbachia bacteria is known to exclusively kill male specimens. === Pupa === The pupa is suspended by just one point. It is brown with a grey tinge on the wings. The abdominal segments have distinct tubercles. The surface of the pupa is rough. The butterfly emerges after seven to eight days as pupae (female development is always a bit longer). == Recent evolutionary changes == On the Samoan Islands of Upolu and Savai'i, a parasite (probably Wolbachia) had been killing the male members of Hypolimnas bolina. The problem was so severe that by the year 2001, males made up only 1% of the population. However, in 2007, it was reported that within a span of just 10 generations (less than a year), the males had evolved to develop immunity to the parasite, and the male population increased to nearly 40%. == Subspecies == Listed alphabetically.

When the fold is opened, the white lower half of the scent patch can be seen. The abdomen has white stripes. The head of the butterfly is rose coloured. Female: Tailless. Above, the butterfly is grey brown. It has dark stripes in between the veins. It has a large pale patch below vein 2 on the upper forewing. Male: Upperside rich velvety blue black. Forewing: outwardly towards the terminal margin and the whole of the hindwing except the dorsal area have in certain lights a rich dark purple bloom, in others a very dark green; dorsal area and the whole inner side of the sexual fold opaque brownish black; outer half of forewing with pale adnervular streaks more or less prominent.

In Sikkim, according to Henry John Elwes and Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville, it occurs from quite low elevations in the Terai up to 7,000 feet (2,100 m). Its almost uniform dark colour renders it inconspicuous in the jungle, and it is therefore difficult to account for its being further protected by a disagreeable smell and probably taste. James Wood-Mason has recorded that the females have a strong and disgustingly rank musky odour. == Taxonomy == There are two subspecies: A. v. astorion (Westwood), 1842 is found from Kumaon to Tavoy. A. v. varuna (White, 1842) is found from Mergui to southern Myanmar and is rare. == Habitat == The Common Batwing occurs from the Terai up to the altitude of 7000 feet. == Habits == The common batwing is a butterfly of hot, low altitude jungles. It has a slow and graceful flight and can be seen cruising along river valleys and high over stream beds. Both sexes frequent flowers, Lantana being a preferred species. It has a disagreeable smell. == Food plants == Family Aristolochiaceae Aristolochia kaempferi == Etymology == It is named for the sky god Varuna in Vedic religion.

A spectacular insect much sought after by collectors, the species epithet is after Dr R. Lidderdale, from whose collection the butterfly was first described by William Stephen Atkinson in 1873. Listed under CITES Appendix II, but not in the Red Book of the IUCN, the status of the butterfly has been recorded as rare by some authorities and insufficiently known in the IUCN Red Data Book on swallowtails. == Description == The sexes of the Bhutan glory are identical in appearance, having long rounded forewings with convex termen and many-tailed hindwings. The butterfly is dull black above with slim, wavy, cream-coloured striations running vertically across the wings. Above, the hindwing has a prominent, large tornal patch with yellow-orange lunules bordering the tails, central bluish-black patches with white ocelli and a crimson post-discal band on the inner edge. Below, the base colour is greyer, the striations are pronounced and the colours subdued or paler. The detailed description provided by Charles Thomas Bingham (1907) is as follows: Males and females have the upperside of wings dull black. Forewing with the following ochraceous white slender markings: basal, sub-basal, medial and preapical lines from costa across cell, the first three continued in a series of more or less diffuse curves to the dorsal margin, the preapical terminates on vein 3; beyond apex of cell a somewhat broken transverse line from costa to vein 3 followed by a complete discal transverse line, a short upper postdiscal somewhat ill-defined line that terminates on vein 4 and a subterminal complete line; all the lines except those that cross the cell formed of a series of short curved lines in the interspaces. Hind wing with similar ochraceous white lines more or less in continuation of those on the forewing with the addition of a broad line along vein 1 and the median vein, these two lines do not reach much beyond the base of vein 4; a large lower discal patch, the inward half scarlet, the outer half velvety-black, followed by broad subterminal bright yellow lunules in interspaces 1 to 4; the tails edged very narrowly with ochraceous white; the black on the outer half of the discal patch has in interspaces 1 and 2 very large ill-defined superposed white spots thickly shaded with brownish grey except along their inner margins. Underside similar, all the markings broader, base of cell in hindwing crossed by a short ochraceous-white bar, and the edges of the pre-costal cell with narrow lines of the same colour. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen dull black; the thorax greenish grey laterally, the sides of the abdomen with cross-lines of ochreous white. Wingspan: 90\u2013110 mm. == Distribution == The butterfly was described by William Stephen Atkinson in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London in 1873. He writes: This fine insect was first discovered in May 1868, near Buxa, in the Bhutan Himalayas, at an elevation of 5000 feet, by Dr R. Lidderdale, of the Bengal Army. Dr Lidderdale obtained two specimens from the same locality in 1872; and from one of these, kindly communicated to me, the foregoing description and the accompanying drawing have been prepared. I am glad to associate Dr Lidderdale's name with this very interesting discovery, which adds a new and remarkable form to the family of Papilionidae. Other specimens have since been taken by Lt H.M. Rose of the Bengal Staff Corps. George Talbot in The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma (1939) provides some interesting detail: [Bhutanitis] lidderdalei was first discovered by Dr. Lidderdale in 1868 in Bhutan, at about 6,000 feet, near Buxa. Between 1886 and 1890 the late H. J. Elwes sent three parties of native collectors from Darjeeling to procure the insect. The first was plundered by the Bhotias, the second was attacked by fever and one of its members died, the third had a man killed by a tiger, and all returned unsuccessful. Specimens were later procured by Mr. A. V. Knyvett, then Inspector of Police, who gave them to Mr. Elwes \u2026 The butterfly is found in Bhutan and north eastern India (Assam, Sikkim, Manipur and Nagaland). It is also found in northern Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and Szechwan and Yunnan provinces of China. == Taxonomy == There are a total of four subspecies of B. lidderdalii. These subspecies (with type localities) are: B. lidderdalii lidderdalii Atkinson 1873 - (nominate) Buxa, Bhutan B. lidderdalii spinosa Stichel, 1907 - Sichuan, China B. lidderdalii ocellatomaculata Igarashi, 1979 - Chiang Mai, northern Thailand B. lidderdalii nobucoae Morita, 1997 - north Kachin, Myanmar == Status == The Bhutan glory has been considered to be rare by Indian authors such as William Harry Evans (1932), Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth (1957) and Isaac Kehimkar (2009). The nominate subspecies is protected under law in India. However Collins and Morris (1985) in the IUCN Red Data Book on the threatened swallowtails of the world gives it a status of insufficiently known arguing that the Bhutan glory is widely distributed and hence unlikely to be in danger at the moment though more information is needed on this comparatively poorly known species, the species not listed in the current Red List of the IUCN. International trade in B. lidderdalii is restricted under CITES Appendix II. Habitat loss due to excessive felling of forests may be a significant threat regionally. The Thai subspecies, found in northern Thailand around Chiang Mai is considered to be a relict population and hundreds of specimens were collected annually for the specimen. It is now believed to be extinct, probably due to loss of the population and damage to its habitat by forest fire. == Habitat == B. lidderdalii flies from 5,000 to 9,000 feet (1,500 to 2,700 m) in its Indian range. It generally keeps to the ridges rather than the valleys. == Habits == Flies at tree-top level, with a slow, drifting, unpredictable flight akin to that of the tree nymph (Idea lynceus). The butterflies transparent greyish underside makes it difficult to distinguish in the shadows. During rain, it sits on leaves with the forewings drooped over the hindwings, concealing its bright upper colouration. The butterfly has a habit of hill-topping and visits flowers of diverse species. Mr. Doherty found this beautiful insect in considerable numbers in the Naga hills. Speaking of its habits and the localities in which it occurs, he says: It generally keeps to the ridges, occasionally descending into the valley, once almost down to 5000 feet. Afterwards I found it on the western side of Japoo at 7000-8000 feet, and between the two places we got one or two every day. At Mas, in Manipur, I have taken worn specimens at 7500-9000 feet. My Lepchas, who collected at Buxa in Bhutan, say there is no chance of another brood.... The butterfly drifts about among the tree tops, rarely descending to the ground; the crimson of the hind wings is not so conspicuous as one might think, and if one loses sight of it for an instant, it is very hard to make out again, its transparent dark grey wings being hardly distinguishable among the shadows, and it is blown about by the wind more like a dead leaf than a living insect. Its flight is much like that of Hestia but less buoyant and circling, as might be expected from its angular wings; nevertheless its resemblance strikes once. Seen from above it must be much more conspicuous and in no doubt a protected insect; at the same time its weak flight may even add to its chance of escape as it certainly does with Hestia, for it is impossible to calculate the direction in which it is making. The whole body and wings give out a delicious odour, which remains for some days after death. In some positions and at some distance Armandia looks like Danais tytia, Gray, which is very common in the same places. Armandia hovers about flowers like other Papilios. During rain it alights on a leaf and droops its forewings over the hindones, thus covering the bright colours. The late Capt. Watson, who recorded this insect from the Chin Hills in Burma states that it is single-brooded. Mr. Doherty however, in the Naga Hills, took several specimens in good condition towards the end of September, so that apparently there is an autumn brood in some localities. == Life cycle == It is known to have two broods - the first in May and June and the second from August to October. Likely to be unpalatable due to its food plant being Aristolochia species. == Food plant == Larva on Aristolochia species such as A. kaempferii, A. mandshuriensis, A. griffithii, A. shimadai and A. debilis (Igarashi, 1985, 1989). == Cited references ==","cmname": "Bhutan glory","family": "Papilionidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "thestylis","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Prioneris","stname": "Prioneris Thestylis","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Prioneris thestylis, the spotted sawtooth, is a small butterfly of the family Pieridae, that is, the yellows and whites, which is found in India and Southeast Asia.","cmname": "Spotted sawtooth Dry-season forms","family": "Pieridae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "evelina","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Dophla","stname": "Dophla Evelina","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Dophla evelina, the redspot duke, is a species of brush-footed butterfly found in South and Southeast Asia (Sri Lanka, Yunnan and India to the Philippines and Sulawesi).

Forewing: cell with two median sinuous short black transverse lines with a crimson spot between them, two similar lines beyond, one before, one after apex of cell; followed by a dark irregular transverse shading between the veins; apex of wing broadly and termen narrowly edged with an obscure dark shading. Hindwing with a slender black loop in cell; very obscure discal and sub terminal dark macular bands and the anterior third of the wing purplish. Underside sap green, largely suffused with plumbeous grey.

Subspecies laudabilis Swinhoe: The southern Indian continental representative of D. evelina seems to form a very distinct race. The male differs in the costa of the forewing on the upperside beyond the dark obscure discal band being broadly greyish white with a silvery lustre up to a little distance before the apex of the wing; this colour spreads downwards diffusely, but does not extend below vein 6. In the female there is a similar patch, very wide on the costa, extending as a broad transverse band with outer diffuse and inner sinuous margin right across the wing to vein 1; on the hindwing it is not represented by a very much narrower transverse diffuse band or irroration of grey scales. Underside male and female,as in the typical form, but more densely suffused with plumbeous grey. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the typical form. == Life history == Larva: The larva of D. e. laudabilis feeds on Diospyros candolleana (Ebenaceae), and is green with a vinaceous (red-wine color) dorsal patch on each segment, enclosing a whitish dark-centred eyespot. These patches vary in size, those on the fourth, seventh and tenth segments being usually the largest, and those on the fifth and sixth small or obsolete. Pupa: Green, with silver spots and a bright line of the same colour along the sides of the dorsal triangle. At least on Borneo but probably elsewhere too, adults are frequently seen drinking juices from old fruits. They indiscriminately seek out such sources of nutrition, whether these are in the shade of the forest or in drier and sunnier open areas. == Footnotes ==","cmname": "Redspot duke Conservation status Not evaluated (IUCN 2.3)","family": "Nymphalidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "phisara","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Gerosis","stname": "Gerosis Phisara","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Gerosis phisara, commonly known as the Dusky Yellow Breasted Flat, is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae. == Distribution == It is found India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar also Burma, Thailand, Laos, Malay Peninsula, Tioman, Yunnan.","cmname": "Dusky Yellow Breasted Flat","family": "Hesperiidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "boeticus","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Lampides","stname": "Lampides Boeticus","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Lampides boeticus, the peablue, pea blue, or long-tailed blue, is a small butterfly that belongs to the lycaenids or gossamer-winged family. == Etymology == The Latin species name boeticus refers to Baetica, a province of the Roman Empire in the Iberian Peninsula . == Distribution == This species can be found in Europe, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Australia == Habitat == This species inhabits the edge of forests, mountain meadows and hot flowery places at an elevation up to 2,700 metres (8,900 ft) above sea level. == Description == The wingspan is 24\u201332 mm for males and 24\u201334 mm for females.

The forewing has the terminal margin narrowly edged with black that broadens very slightly towards the apex of the wing; the cilia are brownish black. The hindwing is uniformly coloured, except for an anticiliary black line faintly edged on the inner side by a white line within which and touching it is a row of black spots, the anterior spots very faint, the spot in interspace 2 large and well-defined, two geminate (paired) spots in interspace 1 and a very small black lunular dot in interspace 1a; cilia brown, white at the base in the interspaces. In specimens obtained in the height of the dry season the black edging to the termen of the forewing is much reduced and the subterminal series of black spots in the hindwing is altogether missing. The underside is greyish brown. The forewing has seven transverse white bands as follows: two short bands one each side of the discocellulars, the inner one continued downwards to vein 1 and both represented at the costa by two detached spots; two parallel discal bands, the inner one broken at and the outer one terminating on vein 3; two parallel subterminal bands, the outer one slightly lunular; lastly, a more slender terminal band followed by an anticiliary slender black line; the dorsal margin narrowly white; cilia brownish black, their bases white in the interspaces. Hindwing: crossed by nine white bands or lines as follows: three between base of wing and apex of cell, those posteriorly in interspace 1 or on vein 1 abruptly turn upwards and terminate on the dorsum; the first band beyond the cell extends from vein 6 to vein 2, then curves upwards in interspace 1; the next extends straight from just below the costa to vein 4, thus overlapping the previous band for a short distance; the next or postdiscal band runs between the costa and vein 3, the subterminal two also between the costa and vein 3 but the inner one of the two bands is extended down to interspace 1 and there curves upwards towards the dorsum; both the subterminal bands are more or less lunular; in the interspace below vein 2 is a large subterminal black spot speckled with metallic blue scales and bordered inwardly by ochraceous orange; there are also in interspaces la and 1 two black dots inwardly edged by a short white streak set in an ochraceous background; lastly, there is a complete terminal white line followed by a black anticiliary line and a filamentous short black white-tipped tail at apex of vein 2; cilia as on the upperside. Antennae brownish black, the shafts as usual tinged with white; head, thorax and abdomen pale brown, bluish on thorax and base of abdomen; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen white, the third joint of the palpi and the second joint anteriorly black. The female has the upperside ground colour paler than in the male, often quite white; terminal black edging to forewing very much broader, broadest at apex, its margin there diffuse. Hindwing: differs from that of the male as follows: costal margin broadly dusky black; a postdiscal transverse series of dusky-black connected lunules often more or less obsolescent; this is followed by a series of black spots each set in a background of the white ground colour; an anticiliary slender black line as in the male. The underside ground colour is paler than in the male, the markings however are identical. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male. === Wet-season brood === Closely resembles the males and females of the dry-season brood; the markings are similar but the ground colour is generally darker both on the upper and undersides, while the black edging to the forewing and the black postdiscal and terminal markings to the hindwing on the upperside are broader and more clearly defined. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the dry-season brood. == Larva == When full-fed just half an inch in length, of a dull reddish-green colour, thickly shagreened with minute white tubercles, scarcely, if at all, hairy; the head pale ochraceous, entirely hidden beneath the second segment; the segments increasing in width to about the fifth, the two anal segments slightly decreasing and above flattened, especially the thirteenth; the erectile organs very small; a dorsal pulsating line, somewhat darker than the rest of the body; a subdorsal series of pale green oblique streaks, one on each segment on each side from the third to the eleventh segment inclusive; no other conspicuous markings. Dr. Forel has identified the ant that attends the larva in Calcutta, as Camponotus mitis, Smith. Dr. G. King identifies the plant on which the larva feeds in Calcutta as Heynea trijuga, Roxburgh.

Hindwing is uniform, except for a preapical short diffuse black streak from the costa, sometimes absent, and a series of terminal black spots that in specimens from moist localities are very large. Underside is white with the cell and apex of forewing suffused with sulphur yellow, the orange patch of the upperside shows through by transparency, its inner edge margined anteriorly by a very obscure oblique fuscous band. Hindwing has the preapical short transverse black streak on the upperside obscurely indicated. The female is very similar to the male but can be distinguished as follows: Upperside of the forewing has a narrower orange patch enclosed within the black apical area; a small black spot in middle of interspace 1 and another in interspace 3. Hindwing has the terminal spots slightly larger. On the underside the apex of forewing and whole surface of hindwing suffused lightly, or in specimens from very dry localities heavily, with ochraceous. Forewing has spots in interspaces 1 and 3 as on the upperside. Hindwing: a curved, almost complete, discal series of fuscous spots; otherwise as in the male. In both sexes the antennae vary from white to pale brownish; head, thorax and abdomen black, the head and thorax with short greyish-brown hairs; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen white. == Range == It is found from the outer ranges of the Himalayas throughout peninsular India except Bengal. Subspecies C. e. limbata is found in Sri Lanka. and it has the black apical area on the forewing darker, broader, occupying about a third of the wing; the orange patch enclosed within it is proportionately narrower, so that the black on its inner margin has the appearance of being broader proportionately than it is in the typical form. Very often this inner edge is bordered by a suffusion of sulphur yellow. Specimens from south Indian hills resemble this closely. === Larva === The larva is narrow and uniformly green with a yellow, white, or pink-tinged line along each side. === Pupa === The pupa is compressed with a long, upturned end. It is green when new, turning a brown-mottled grey. == Biology == The food plants of this species include the toothbrush tree (Salvadora persica), pilu (Salvadora oleiodes), and Indian cadaba (Cadaba indica). == Subspecies == Colotis etrida etrida (India) Colotis etrida limbata Butler, 1876 (Sri Lanka)","cmname": "Colotis etrida","family": "Pieridae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "nora","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Prosotas","stname": "Prosotas Nora","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Prosotas nora, the common lineblue, is a species of lycaenid butterfly found in Asia. == Description == Male upperside: purplish brown or purplish with a dark tint, some specimens brown with a very slight purplish sheen seen only in certain lights. Forewings and hindwings: nearly uniform, both with slender black anticiliary lines, the hindwing in addition with the costal and dorsal margins paler; in most specimens with a subterminal black spot in interspace 2, sometimes seen only by transparency from the underside; tail black tipped with white. Underside: brown, hoary, brownish or pale dull brown. Forewing: a subbasal pair of transverse white strigae, a shorter pair along the discocellulars and a discal pair; these strigae all narrowly edged on the inner sides of each pair with fuscous which gives the appearance of transverse bands somewhat darker than the ground colour; the subbasal pair extend from vein 1 to vein 12, the discocellular pair from upper to lower apex of cell and the discal pair are very irregular and dislocated at each vein, the whole having the appearance of a dark sinuous band; terminal markings often very faint and ill defined or again fairly prominent and consisting of a double subterminal series of transversely linear, sometimes lunular, dark spots, with edgings paler than the ground colour; lastly, an anticiliary dark line. Hindwing: with transverse pairs of white, inwardly fuscous-edged strigae similar to those on the forewing, but even more irregular and broken; the subbasal pair extended from costa to vein 1, below which the dorsal area is whitish, the discocellular pair extend from the costa and posteriorly coalesce with the discal pair which are as irregular and dislocated as in the forewing; terminal markings similar to those on the forewing, but the double subterminal series of dark spots more lunular and a prominent round black subterminal spot crowned with ochraceous in interspace 2. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown; the shafts of the antennae speckled with white; beneath: the palpi fringed with black, thorax dark greyish brown, abdomen white. Female upperside: brownish purple, sometimes fuscous. Forewings and hindwings: as in the male with anticiliary dark lines, but differ as follows: Forewing: an iridescent bluish sheen from base outwards to disc; hindwing; a slender more or less prominent white line edging the anticiliary black line on the inner side, a sub terminal geminate (paired) double black spot in interspace 1 and a similar larger single spot in interspace 2.

There are ten subspecies. A specimen from Java is the type species of the genus. == Description == A small butterfly, the green dragontail has a wingspan of 40 to 55 millimetres (1.6 to 2.2 in). It is basically black and white in colour scheme, it has a very large white-tipped tail, 25 to 40 millimetres (0.98 to 1.57 in) long. The forewing has a triangular hyaline (glass-like) patch with black borders, and thin black stripes along the veins, forming six to eight spot/bands. It also has a pale band running obliquely across the pre-discal area. This band is continued onto the black hindwing which bears the long tail and prominent abdominal wing fold. In this species, the pale bands are light green while in its closely related species, Lamproptera curius, they are white. Also in L. curius, the white band has a hyaline outer edge. Sexes are alike, but the female is duller and has a ventral copulation groove before the tip of the abdomen. The males of this species do not have the sex mark (scent organ) found in L. curius. == Distribution == The butterfly is found in northeastern India, in the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. It is also found in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, southern China (including Hainan), Cambodia, peninsular and eastern Malaysia, the Indonesian archipelago, Brunei, and the Philippines. In Indonesia, it is found on the islands of Sulawesi, Kalimantan, Nias, Bangka and Java. In 2006, it was reported from Zhangjiajie of Hunan Province. == Subspecies == L. m. meges Sumatra, Java, Borneo L. m. ennius (C. & R.

In a study of swallowtail assemblages in Rani-Garbhanga Reserve Forest in Assam in 2003 and 2004, dragontails (Lamproptera species) were found to have one of the lowest mean abundances; both L. meges and L. curius being found in gaps (open patches) as well as in closed forest. A 2004 report had earlier suggested that the status of the green dragontail in Garbhanga Reserve Forest was very rare; later a total of 108 butterflies of Lamproptera genus were seen during the 2003 and 2004 survey, the species-wise breakdown not being published. == Habits == Among the smallest of swallowtails in India, the green dragontail is usually found singly along open sunlit patches, almost always near streams and water courses. It may also be seen in small groups, usually twos or threes. It flies in an altitude range of 100 to 1,520 metres (330 to 4,990 ft). It flies from April to October. Having much smaller wing size to body length ratio, the butterflies have a whirring flight, rapidly beat their wings and dart back and forth in a manner reminiscent of dragonflies, their long tails acting as rudders. Male dragontails suck up a lot of water from which the dissolved minerals are filtered and the water squirted from the anus. While feeding they vibrate their wings rapidly but pause from time to time. Occasionally, they rest on leaves of bushes with wings outspread and stationary. === Life cycle === The eggs are pale green, spherical, smooth, almost transparent and resemble the eggs of other swallowtails. The caterpillar is dark green in colour and is spotted with black. The chrysalis is attached to the upper surface of a leaf by the cremaster. === Food plants === Illigera burmanica King (family Hernandiaceae). In the Philippines, the butterfly has also been recorded from Zanthoxylum species (Rutaceae).","cmname": "Green dragontail","family": "Papilionidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "cama","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Athyma","stname": "Athyma Cama","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Athyma cama, the orange staff sergeant, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in tropical and subtropical Asia.","cmname": "Orange staff sergeant Female upperside.

The butterfly is also known as the common lime butterfly, lemon butterfly, lime swallowtail, small citrus butterfly, chequered swallowtail, dingy swallowtail and citrus swallowtail. These common names refer to their host plants, which are usually citrus species such as the cultivated lime. Unlike most swallowtail butterflies, it does not have a prominent tail. The butterfly is a pest and invasive species from Asia and Australia which has spread to the Caribbean and Central America. == Description == The butterfly is tailless and has a wingspan 80\u2013100 mm. Above, the background colour is black. A broad, irregular yellow band is found on the wings above, which is broken in the case of the forewing. Besides this the butterfly has a large number of irregular spots on the wing. The upper hindwing has a red tornal spot with blue edging around it. As the caterpillar ages, its hunger for leaf tissue continues to grow. Detailed description as given by Charles Thomas Bingham in 1905: Upper side of wings has the ground colour black. The fore wing has the base below cell and basal half of latter so irrorated with yellow scales as to form more or less complete transverse dotted lines, two outwardly oblique yellow spots in cell and a curved spot at its upper apex; a spot at base and another beyond it in interspace 8; a discal transverse series of cream-yellow spots irregular in arrangement and size extends from interspace la to 8; the series interrupted in interspace 5 and the spot in interspace 7 double; this is followed by a sinuous postdiscal series of spots and an admarginal terminal series of smaller spots. In many specimens between the discal and postdiscal series the black ground-colour is irrorated with yellowish scales. Hind wing: base and an edging that decreases in width along the dorsal margin irrorated with yellow scales; followed by a broad medial yellow irregular band, a sinuous postdiscal series of outwardly emarginate yellow spots and a terminal series of smaller similarly coloured spots as on the fore wing. The inner margin of the medial band is curved inwards, the outer margin is very irregular and uneven; in the cell the band does not reach the apex, but beyond the cell there are one or more cream-yellow spots, and the black groundcolour is irrorated with yellowish scales; finally at the tornal angle there is an oval ochraceous-red spot emarginate on its inner side in the female and in both sexes surmounted by a blue lunule; while in interspace 7 between the medial band and the postdiscal spot there is a large ocellus-like spot of the black ground-colour more or less irrorated with blue scales. The underside has the ground-colour similar, the cream-coloured markings paler and conspicuously larger. The markings differ from those on the upperside in that the forewing has the basal half of cell and base of wing below it with cream-coloured streaks that coalesce at base; irregular ochraceous spots in interspaces 5 to 8 and the discal series of spots complete not interrupted in interspace 5. On the underside of the hind wing, the black at base of wing and along the dorsal margin centred largely with pale cream-colour; the ocellus in interspace 7, the apex of the cell and the black groundcolour between the medial band and postdiscal markings in interspaces 2-6 centred with ochraceous, margined with blue. Antennae dark reddish brown, touched with ochraceous on the innerside towards the club; head, thorax and abdomen dusky black, the head and thorax anteriorly streaked with cream-vellow: beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen cream-yellow with lateral longitudinal black lines on the last. == Status, range and habitat == Papilio demoleus is an aggressive and very common butterfly. It is perhaps the most widely distributed swallowtail in the world. The butterfly can be found in: Oman, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Iran, western and possibly eastern Afghanistan, and western Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India (including the Andamans), Nepal, Burma, Thailand, the Philippines, Kampuchea, southern China (including Hainan, Guangdong province), Taiwan, Japan (rare strays), Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sula, Talaud, Flores, Alor and Sumba), Papua New Guinea, Australia (including Lord Howe's island), apparently Hawaii and possibly other Pacific Ocean islands. Formerly absent from Borneo it is now one of the commonest papilionids in Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo, Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and in Brunei. In recent years the butterfly has spread to Hispaniola island (Dominican Republic) in the Western Hemisphere, and subsequently to Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The Dominican population originated from Southeast Asia but how the butterfly reached there is not known. The widespread range of Papilio demoleus indicates the butterfly's tolerance and adaptation to diverse habitats. It is to be found in savannahs, fallow lands, gardens, evergreen and semi-evergreen forests and shows a preference for stream and riverbeds. In India it is mostly found in the plains but can be found on the hills of peninsular India and up to 7,000 feet (2,100 m) in the Himalayas. It is common in urban gardens and may also be encountered in wooded country. The butterfly is also a very successful invader, its spread appearing to be due to its strong flight, increase in urbanisation and agricultural land use that opens up new areas for dispersal, and greater availability of food plants. == Taxonomy == Five related butterflies form the group of lime butterflies in the genus Papilio of which Papilio demoleus Linnaeus, 1758 is the flagship species which gives the name to the group. The other morphologically related butterflies are: Papilio demodocus (Esper, 1798) Papilio erithonioides Grose-Smith, 1891 Papilio grosesmithi Rothschild, 1926 Papilio morondavana Grose-Smith, 1891 The citrus swallowtail (Papilio demodocus Esper), flies in Sub-Saharan Africa where the common lime butterfly (subspecies Papilio demoleus demoleus) is also found while the other three species are endemic to Madagascar. Research into the biogeography, phylogeny, and analysis of vicariance relationships dating back to the Cretaceous, of the lime butterfly or demoleus group, suggest that the group of lime swallowtails diversified in Madagascar in the middle Miocene. Six subspecies are recognised in Papilio demoleus: P. d. demoleus Linnaeus, 1758 \u2014 Across Asia from China to the Arabian peninsula, and now in some islands in the West Indies, including Jamaica P. d. libanius Fruhstorfer, 1908 \u2014 Taiwan, Philippines, Sula, Talaud. P. d. malayanus Wallace, 1865 \u2014 Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula. P. d. novoguineensis Rothschild, 1908 \u2014 Papua New Guinea. P. d. sthenelus Macleay, 1826 \u2014 Australia. P. d. stenelinus Rothschild, 1895 \u2014 Sumba, Flores and Alor. == Behavior == This butterfly is an avid mud-puddler and visitor of flowers. It basks with its wings held wide open on tufts of grass, herbs and generally keeps within a metre of the ground, even on cloudy days. It relies on its quick flight for escape. It is an interesting butterfly in that it has a number of modes of flight. In the cool of the morning, the flight is slow considering that it is an edible and unprotected swallowtail. As the day progresses, it flies fast, straight and low. In the hotter part of the day, it may be found settling on damp patches where it will remain motionless, except for an occasional flutter of wings, if not disturbed. It is also a frequent visitor of flowers in gardens, where it shows a preference for flowers of smaller herbs rather than larger plants such as the ubiquitous Lantana with its plentiful blooms. It can be found swarming in the groves of its food plants. Research on freshly emerged imagines of Papilio demoleus showed that they have an inborn or spontaneous preference while feeding for blue and purple colours while the yellow, yellowish-green, green and blue-green colours are completely neglected. == Life cycle == The number of generations of Papilio demoleus is dependent upon temperature \u2013 near the equator, nine generations have been recorded, while in warm temperate China, five generations have been recorded. In the ideal conditions of a laboratory, a generation has been recorded to take place in just over 30 days. The average time for one generation of Papilio demoleus to mature in the field ranges from 26 to 59 days. In cold climates, the lime butterfly is known to pass the winter as pupae. Typically, the butterfly undergoes five instars as a caterpillar. The female butterfly goes from plant to plant, laying a single egg at a time on top of a leaf which it holds onto with its legs, and flies off as soon as the egg is laid. The egg is round, light yellowish in colour, flattened at the base, smooth surfaced and about 1.5 mm in height. Fertile eggs develop a small red mark at the apex. The newly hatched caterpillar stays in the middle of the upperside of the leaf. The first instar of the caterpillar is black, with a black heads and two rows of sub-dorsal fleshy spines. The second, third and fourth instars are dark, with glossy, dark-brown head, and white markings on the 8th and 9th segments of the caterpillar which resemble a white patch of uric acid deposited in a bird's droppings, helping them escape predation while remaining in moderately open places. As the instars progress, this resemblance is lost. From the fifth instar onwards, the caterpillars now turn cylindrical in shape, tapered towards the rear, and uniformly pale green in colour with a white sub-spiracular band. An additional black band is developed on the fourth and fifth segments with two black and two bluish spots on them. The eighth and ninth segments, which earlier provided the camouflage markings now develop a brown and white band. At this stage, the caterpillars are forced to inhabit secluded places. The pupa, which is rugose (wrinkled), stout and 30 mm in length, has two projections to the front on its head and also one on its thorax and resembles that of the common Mormon (Papilio polytes), the difference being that the common Mormon pupa has a deeper cut between the projections and its abdomen is more protruded on the sides, having a small point. The pupa is dimorphic with regards to colour, with the colour developing according to the prevalent colour and texture in the background. The green morph, which is found amongst green vegetation and smoother textures, is light green and unmarked or with yellow dorsal markings. When situated among brown or dry objects, the pupa tend to turn light grey brown to pink brown and develop cryptic dark brown and black striation. The adults fly in every month but are particularly abundant during and after the monsoons. Captive breeding of Papilio demoleus in Riyadh have revealed the following data about the life-span of various stages at that locality: Number of generations per year: 8 Duration of egg stage: 3.1 to 6.1 days Duration of larva stage: 12.9 and 22.7 days Duration of pupa stage: 8.0 to 22.4 days Duration of adult stage: 4 to 6 days with average of 5.1 days === Parasitism and predation === Despite their two-stage camouflage scheme, some caterpillars of Papilio demoleus are found by parasitic wasps which lay dozens of eggs in them. The parasitic wasp larva eat the caterpillar from the inside. Initially the vital organs are avoided, but by the time the caterpillar is ready to pupate even the vital organs are consumed. Shortly before, or soon after the caterpillar pupates, the parasitoids emerge from their host thus killing it. In Saudi Arabia, the highest mortality rate was found to be in larvae and pupae in cultivated populations due to a bacterium of the genus Bacillus. In addition, eggs and larvae were heavily predated upon by two unidentified species of spiders which were abundant on citrus trees. In China, species of fungi in the genus Ophiocordyceps are known to parasitize many kinds of caterpillars including Papilio demoleus. The spores was spread out of the parents fungi, and infect the young caterpillar, then when the caterpillar becomes pupa, they will fail to develop into an adult butterfly, instead the fungi kill and eat the caterpillar flesh from within, and grow a spore bud out of the dead caterpillar corpse. The fungi was known as d\u014dng ch\u00f3ng xi\u00e0 c\u01ceo are thought to have medicinal properties in China, and are known in English as caterpillar fungus. In India, the following braconid wasp parasitoids are known to parasitize Papilio demoleus larvae: Apanteles species including Apanteles papilionis Habrobracon hebetor In Thailand, a number of organisms have been recorded attacking immature stages of Papilio demoleus: Egg parasites - Ooencyrtus malayensis Ferriere (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) Tetrastichus sp. (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) Larval stage - Erycia nymphalidophaga Baronoff (Diptera: Tachinidae) (parasite) Cantheconidea furcellata (Wolff) (Pentatomidae predator Other natural enemies of larvae included reduviid bugs; birds; spiders; sphecid wasps; and chameleons. Pupal parasites - Brachymeria sp. (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae) Pteromalus puparum Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) Ophiocordyceps was a genus of fungi that its spore got into the caterpillar, and start to eat the pupa from within growing a spore stalk out the cocoon, which is commonly known as caterpillar fungus. In Jamaica, an encyrtid egg parasitoid and a chalcidoid parasitoid have been reported. == Food plants == The larval food plants of Papilio demoleus in Asia are from family Rutaceae while in Australia and Papua New Guinea the butterfly also feeds on host-plants of family Fabaceae. === Family Rutaceae === Cultivated lime, orange and lemon. C. aurantifolia, C. grandis, C. limon, C. sinensis, Atalanta racemosa Glycosmis pentaphylla, Glycosmis arborea Ruta graveolens Bael (Aegle marmelos) Murraya koenigii Chloroxylon swietenia Acronychia pedunculata Microcitrus australis (Australian round-lime, Australian lime) === Family Rhamnaceae === Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) === Family Fabaceae === They have been observed on: Many species of Cullen: Cullen australasicum, C. badocanum, C. balsamicum, C. cinereum, C. patens (spreading scurf-pea, native verbine), C. pustulatum, and C. tenax (tough scurf-pea, emu-foot, emu grass), and C. leucanthum. Psoralea pinnata (fountain bush). == Economic significance == The lime butterfly is an economic pest on many cultivated citrus species in India, Pakistan, Iraq and the Middle East. Due to its history of successful dispersal and range extension, the lime butterfly is likely to spread from its original point of introduction in Hispaniola in the Caribbean to neighbouring Florida, Central America and South America. Due to its capability for rapid population growth under favourable circumstances and its having been recorded to have five generations in a year in temperate regions of China, it is considered a serious potential threat. The caterpillars can completely defoliate young citrus trees (below 2 feet) and devastate citrus nurseries. In mature trees, caterpillars may prefer young leaves and leaf flush. Hand-picking of caterpillars and spraying with endosulfan 35 EC (2 ml/10 litres of water) were the recommended means of pest control by Indian government agencies and agricultural colleges, however, endosulfan has since been banned by the Supreme Court of India.","cmname": "Papilio demoleus Ventral view Dorsal view","family": "Papilionidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "ceylanica","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Pareronia","stname": "Pareronia Ceylanica","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Pareronia ceylanica, the dark wanderer, is a medium-sized butterfly of the family Pieridae, that is, the yellows and whites. It is found in South and South-east Asia. == Description == The dark wanderer resembles Pareronia valeria in colour and in the disposition of the markings, but differs as follows: Male upperside: ground colour a deeper blue. Forewing: the terminal black border much broader generally, entirely without the transverse sub-terminal series of bluish-white spots; in a few specimens there are one or two of these spots present, but nothing like the series so conspicuous in P. valeria hippia. Hindwing: the terminal black border very broad, narrowing slightly but distinctly towards the tornal angle. Proportionately this border is even broader than in the forewing. Underside: as in P. valeria. The female closely resembles the female of P. valeria, but on the upperside the outer black margins beyond the discal markings on both forewings and hindwings are proportionately much broader, the transverse subterminal series of spots that crosses the wing is further from the terminal edge. On the underside the terminal black borders are broader and darker, the subterminal series of spots on apex of the forewing and on the hindwing absent or so very thickly overlaid with the dusky brownish black of the terminal margin as to be very indistinct and blurred. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen in both sexes much as in P. valeria hippia. == Range == This species lives in southern India, the Western Ghats, the southern Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka. == Larva == Long, cylindrical or slightly depressed and tapering slightly from the head, which is large, to the tail which ends in two short strong spines clothed with bristles. The body is clothed with very minute hairs. Colour green, with a lateral row of conspicuous white spots from the 5th to the 12th segment and rows of smaller spots on the back. Food-plant, Capparis heyneana. == Pupa == Suspended by the tail and by a very long band ... thoracic portion bent back almost at right angles to the abdominal; head produced into a very long sharp snout; wing-cases forming a keel nearly half an inch in depth, and so thin as to be almost transparent.

There are approximately sixteen subspecies with differing geographical distributions. == Description == Upperside opaque black. Forewings and hindwings crossed from above the tornal area on the hindwing to near the apex of the forewing by a semi-hyaline broad pale blue medial band which is broadest in the middle, more or less greenish and macular anteriorly; the portion of the band that crosses interspaces 6, 7 and 8 on the hindwing white; beyond the band on the hindwing there is a sub-terminal line of blue slender lunules. Underside similar, ground colour dark brown. Hindwing: a short comparatively broad sub-basal band from costa to sub-costal vein, and the postdiscal area between the medial blue band and the sub-terminal lunules velvety black traversed by the pale veins and transversely, except in interspaces 6 and 7, by narrow crimson lines; lastly, a crimson spot near the tornal angle with an admarginal yellowish-white spot below it. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen brown, the head and thorax suffused with greenish grey; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen touched with dingy white, the abdomen with two whitish lateral lines. Male has abdominal fold within grey, furnished with a tuft of long, somewhat stiff white hairs. Race teredon, Felder. (South India and Sri Lanka) is distinguishable in both sexes by the narrower medial band that crosses both forewing and hindwing. Colour brighter, the contrast between the green of the upper and the blue of the lower portion of the medial band more vivid. Hindwing more produced posteriorly at apex of vein 3, where it forms an elongate tooth or short tail. Variously reported with wingspans between 55 and 75 mm, the common bluebottle has black upper wings and brown lower wings. Both forewings and hindwings are marked by a central spot in the form of a blue or blue-green triangle, with apex pointing toward the body. == Habitat == Graphium sarpedon is primarily an inhabitant of moist, low-level rain forests (below 1600 m (5000 ft)). In these elevations it is usually seen flying just above the tree canopy. The larvae of the common bluebottle feed on trees of the laurel family, which includes the cinnamon tree, and have expanded their range to include cinnamon tree plantations. In eastern Australia, they have adapted to a drier subtropical environment, and are commonly seen in suburban gardens in Queensland and New South Wales. == Distribution == The known distributions of some of the sixteen recognized subspecies: G. s. sarpedon (Linnaeus, 1758) - India, Sri Lanka G. s. teredon - India, Sri Lanka G. s. semifasciatus - China G. s. connectens - China, Taiwan G. s. nipponum - Japan G. s. messogis - Indonesia, Solomon Islands, New Guinea G. s. islander Monastyrskii, 2012 - Vietnam G. s. wetterensis Okano, 1993 - Indonesia, Lesser Sunda Islands, Wetter Island G. s. choredon - eastern Australia G. s. luctatius - Malaysia G. s. isander (Godman & Salvin, 1888) - Bougainville Island, Shortland Islands, Santa Isabel Island, Guadalcanal, Florida Islands, Choiseul Island. Subspecies found in India occur in southern India in the Western Ghats and in the Himalayas from Kashmir in the west to Myanmar. G. s. milon and G. s. monticolum, however, are not listed here as they are regarded as separate species in a number of works. == Behaviour == The males are known for their habit of feeding by the edges of puddles, often at the roadside. Occasionally, as many as eight will be seen at the same puddle. They have also been known to be attracted to animal droppings, carcasses and rotting insects. It has been recorded as a migrant in South India and is known to mud-puddle during migration. The butterfly has been seen as comprising as much as 5% of the population of migrating butterflies during a 72-hour period in the Nilgiri hills. The common bluebottle is known for quick flight and rapid reactions. Consequently, it is difficult to catch. === Diet === The adult common bluebottle feeds on nectar from a variety of flowering herbs. The larvae feed primarily on the leaves of trees in the families Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Sapotaceae, and Rutaceae. In particular, G.s. sarpedon and G.s. teredon often feed on leaves of the cinnamon bark tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) or of the Indian laurel (Litsea sebifera). The list of larval food plants also include Alseodaphne semecarpifolia, Cinnamomum camphora, Cinnamomum macrocarpum, Cinnamomum malabathrum, Litsea chinensis, Polyalthia longifolia, Miliusa tomentosa, Persea macrantha and Michelia doltospa. The larvae of G. s. choredon, native to Australia, feed on many native Australian species of genera Cryptocarya and Litsea; and virtually all subspecies feed on leaves of the camphor tree, Cinnamomum camphora, which is native to China but has been naturalized throughout south-east Asia. == Life cycle == === Egg === The egg is yellowish, laid singly on the leaves of a host plant. === Larva === When young, is black or dark green, with numerous spines; when full grown, it is green with a short spines on each thoracic segment and anal segment. There is a transverse yellow band on the 4th segment and a lateral band on the body. The caterpillar usually lies on the centre of a leaf on an upper surface. It is very sluggish and pupates near its feeding spot. Frederic Moore quoted in Bingham, 1907, described it as: Smooth, thickened from the second to the 5th segment and thence decreasing to the end; with two short subdorsal fleshy spines on the 4th segment, between which is a transverse pale yellow line, two shorter spines also on the 2nd and 3rd and two on the anal segment; colour green, with a longitudinal posterior lateral and lower pale yellowish line. === Pupa === The pupa is green with a slender and pointed thoractic projection, yellowish wing cases and lateral bands. Conical, truncated in front; thorax produced into a lengthened obtusely-pointed frontal process.

The hindwing is sometimes immaculate, sometimes with a series of terminal spots at the apices of the veins, sometimes with a narrow dusky-black terminal band broadest near the apex, narrowed posteriorly to a slender line at the tornus. In the very dark specimens there is in addition an ill-defined, short anterior postdiscal macular black band. The underside is as in the male, with similar variations, but in addition in most specimens the discocellular spots are well defined with an outer red ring that encircles a silvery spot; on the hindwing one or two similar spots on each side of the discocellulars; generally also both wings are crossed by a transverse postdiscal line of minute red spots, which on the forewing is confined to the anterior portion, on the hindwing is nearly complete. In both sexes: antennae reddish, head and thorax anteriorly brown, thorax clothed posteriorly with long white hairs, abdomen white: beneath: the palpi, thorax, and abdomen white. == Life history == The host plants of the species include Cassia species (e.g., C. fistula; C. javanica or C. roxburghii; C. bakeriana), Gnidia glauca, Senna species (e.g. S. alata; S. auriculata; S. garrettiana), Crotalaria species, Ormocarpum cochinchinense, Sesbania species and Colocasia.

Forewing has base and basal half of costa flushed with pale blue; costa and termen edged by a slender dark brownish-block even line, beyond which along the termen the cilia are brown, at base, white outwardly. Hindwing: costa somewhat broadly dusky black; a slender black conspicuous anticiliary line, beyond which the cilia are white traversed medially by a brown line; dorsum broadly pale brown, two subterminal pale-bordered black spots in interspace 1, and one similar spot in interspace 2, often obsolescent and barely indicated.

Sometimes the ground colour on the underside is much paler, almost white, especially in the female. == Larva == Food plants include Glycosmis arborea. Pale green at all stages, on the shade or the young leaves of the lime and pummelo bushes on which it feeds. When full-grown it is about seven-sixteenths of an inch in length, onisciform as usual; the head black, smooth and shining, with a somewhat dark green dorsal line down the body, the whole surface but very slightly shagreened and covered with extremely fine and short downy hairs. The constriction between the segments slight. There are traces of two pale subdorsal lines, and there is a pale lateral line below the spiracles. The usual extensile organ on the twelfth segment short. This larva has no distinctive markings by which it can be easily recognized; it is altogether a very plainly coloured and marked insert.

The butterfly ranges over the complete Indian subcontinent and is also found in the Andaman islands. The type locality is South India. == Status == As per William Harry Evans (1932), the butterfly is common in India and rare in the Andaman islands. Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth (1957) records it as Not Rare and Locally Common. Krushnamegh Kunte (2000) reports it as common in deciduous forests during the monsoon months and the evergreen forests in the following months. == Habits == A forest butterfly, the brown awl favours openings and edges of deciduous and evergreen forests while its caterpillars are to be found in moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. It flies about either late or early in the morning in the shade of the jungles. It can be sometimes seen in bright sunlight visiting flowers, such as Glycosmis, Buddleia, Chromolaena and Lantana, but is very wary and energetic at such times, moving jerkily and rapidly between flowers or across inflorescences. It can also be seen mud-puddling or at bird droppings. During a population explosion, like those of the common banded awl (Hasora chromus), the caterpillars of the brown awl may strip away all their food supply forcing the butterflies to migrate to other places where a fresh supply of host plants is available and even to other habitats such as shrubs, grasslands and gardens. The brown awl flies as low as 6 feet over the bushes or as high as 60 to 75 feet in the canopy. The adults feed at lower levels on flowers of shrubs and small trees, but ascend to higher reaches of the vegetation to lay eggs or to bask, which it does very occasionally, holding its wings flat with the forewings covering the hindwings thus giving an arrowhead effect. The flight of the butterfly is fast and bounding with an audible wing beat. When inactive, it rests on the undersides of leaves in shady forest spots, with the head pointing downwards. If disturbed it will generally buzz around energetically before returning to the same spot to rest. == Description == The brown awl is a non-descript brown butterfly, darker above and lighter below. The sexes are alike, except for three to four semi-transparent spots on the forewing which cannot be differentiated in the field. The skipper has a light-brown abdomen with black bands across it. The dry-season form is usually smaller, paler, and may not have the forewing spots. This skipper is unmistakable because of its long and narrow wings. It has the longest wings in proportion to breadth of all Indian butterflies. === Detailed description === Edward Yerbury Watson (1891) gives a detailed description: Genus characters Forewing, narrow, elongated; costa slightly arched at base, exterior margin very oblique and slightly convex below the apex; cell very long and narrow, extending three-fourths the wing; first subcostal branch emitted at two-fifths, second at one-fifth, third at one-seventh, fourth close to and fifth at end of the cell; disco-cellulars very slender, inwardly oblique, of nearly equal length, upper bent inward close to subcostal; upper radial from the angle, lower from their middle; median branches curved at their base, middle branch emitted at about one-fourth, and lower at three-fourths before end of the cell; submedian curved in the middle; hindwing short; apex very convex, angularly lobed at anal angle, abdominal margin short; precostal projecting inward; costal vein arched upward from the base; second subcostal emitted at one-third from the base; cell broad throughout; disco-cellulars very slender, scarcely visible, of equal length; radial from their angle, very slender; middle median at about one-third, and lower at one-fifth from the base; submedian straight, internal slightly curved. Thorax stout; abdomen rather long, attenuated; head broad; palpi broad and flattened in front, bristly on outer edge, third joint long,projected forward, cylindrical; fore-tibiae tufted beneath, femora slightly pilose beneath; antennae with a lengthened club and long pointed tip. Species description Upperside dark purplish brown, the base of both wings greyish olive brown. Male. Forewing with three transparent slender yellow spots disposed longitudinally on the upper disc, the inner spot ending within the cell. Female. Forewing with the spots larger, the middle spot oblique and irregularly angulated; a less distinct spot also above the middle of sub-median vein. Underside pale greyish brown: forewing with discal area darker brown, the spots as above, and pale ochreous posterior border: hindwing with a dark brown anal area bordered above by a short pale ochreous streak. Thorax greyish olive brown; abdomen dark brown with pale ochreous segmental bands; head and palpi in front pale ochreous with brown streaks; third joint of palpi brown; legs brown above, pale beneath. == Similar species == Unlike the other awls, the brown awl lacks the narrow white wing bands on the hindwings. The very distinctive characteristics of the brown awl are the characteristic shape of the body and the narrower wings than the other awls. == Life cycle == === Eggs === The brown awl lays many eggs on a single plant, one at a time, on the tips of fresh shoots. The dome-shaped egg is pale green with longitudinal ridges having fine beadings; a total 13 ridges in all. === Larva === The larva is a pale violaceous (violet) yellow, with numerous black transverse dorsal lines; the prolegs are whitish encircled with black. The head is yellow, approximately heart shaped, with a black band and many tiny black spots. On hatching the larva webs the edges of leaves together with silk to form a roomy cell from a leaf in which it resides throughout the larval stage. When disturbed, it can move quite briskly and even drop off. The caterpillars of the brown awl grow faster than most of those of other families, and have moist, sticky droppings. At the time of pupation they descend close to the ground, looking for suitable spots to pupate. The caterpillar constructs a tubular cell from a leaf by drawing the edges together with thick strands of silk. In this cell, the caterpillar prepares an extensive silk bed on which it sits awaiting pupation. The freshly formed pupa clings onto the silken pad almost immediately. === Pupa === The pupa is stubby, with protruding eyes and a prominent projection on the head in between them. The pupa may be light brown or violaceous. The body tapers away from the shoulders towards the rear. The abdomen is creamish with a row of four black spots on each side. The pupa is shiny, but plastered with a white powder. === Host plants === The caterpillars have been recorded on the following deciduous and semi-evergreen forest plants, mostly from the family Combretaceae: Large climbing shrubs of Combretum such as Combretum albidum, Combretum latifolium and Combretum ovalifolium. Large forest trees of Terminalia genus such as Terminalia bellerica, Terminalia catappa and Terminalia oblongata. Hiptage benghalensis (Malpighiaceae) Linociera purpurea.

It is found in Asia. == Description == Male Male upperside, forewing: velvety black, an elongate broad medial patch dark orange red, that extends from base outwards for about three-fourths the length of the wing and fills the area from vein 1 to the middle of the cell; in some specimens diffusely, spread below vein 1 near base, but there shaded with dusky black; the outer margin of this red patch unevenly rounded. Hindwing: brownish black, a large orange-red spot above vein 3 to near apex, inwardly extended into the cell to near the base of the wing and posteriorly diffuse below vein 3, but in the cell thickly overlaid with dusky-black scaling and posteriorly shaded with long brown hairs that in certain lights take a golden tint; above the cell extended from the base of the wing to the inner margin of the orange spot is a prominent broad streak of a shade darker than the ground colour; abdominal fold pale pinkish brown. Underside: silvery white with sparsely scattered minute black dots. Forewing: a discal and inner subterminal series of very indistinct somewhat lunular black markings that form broken anteriorly convergent bands, which are continued over the hindwing to the tornus; beyond these, on both forewings and hindwings, succeeds an outer subterminal series of minute black dots, in most specimens very indistinct. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown; sides of the abdomen golden brown; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female Female upperside: more or less as in the male, but the dark orange-red medial patches replaced by white and much larger. On the forewing this white patch extends above the cell, the discocellulars closing which are prominently marked by a black tooth, and posteriorly it reaches the dorsal margin. On the hindwing the white patch is very large and in some specimens very diffuse. Both forewings and hindwings are shaded at the base by dusky scales and in many specimens the markings of the underside are plainly visible by transparency; the broad black streak above the cell on the hindwing is present in some, absent in other specimens. Underside: ground colour and markings as in the male, but much more prominent. === Variety dentata === Male Upperside golden or coppery orange o\u00a3 a shade paler than the orange patch in the typical form. Forewing: costal margin broadly black, the width of the black colour increasing to the apex and continued from below that in an even border along the termen to the tornus, thence along the apical third of the dorsum, ending more or less diffusely in a point; discocellulars marked by a prominent tooth extended from the black costal border. Hindwing: base and dorsal area lightly irrorated (sprinkled) with fuscous scales, the latter also shaded with long pale brown hairs; termen with a blackish border of varying width but generally widest in the middle, its inner margin more or less diffuse; costal margin broadly pale yellow. Underside: silvery white; markings similar to but in some specimens even more indistinct than in bulis. Antennae, head and thorax of a paler brown than in bulis; sides of the abdomen golden yellow; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female Female upperside: similar to that of the male, but the orange replaced by white, the black costal and terminal borders on the forewing broader; on the dorsal margin the border is continued further towards the base; the diseocellular black tooth-like mark as prominent as in the male. Hindwing: the white area very much smaller than the similar orange area on the hindwing of the male and confined to the apical third of the wing; a short, broad, clavate (club like), black streak extends from the base outwards above the cell. Underside as in the male but the markings more prominent. === Variety angulata Moore === Differs from bulis in the shape of the hindwing, which has the termen very strongly angulate in the middle in both sexes. In both male and female also the apex of the fore and tornal angle of the hindwing are highly acuminate, in the forewing the apex is, in most specimens, falcate (sickle shaped). Male upperside: differs from the upperside of the typical form in the greater extent and paler colour of the orange-red areas on both forewings and hindwings. On the forewing the discocellulars are marked by a black tooth as in var. dentata, and on the hindwing the orange-red ground colour extends posteriorly to vein 2, but along the dorsum it is heavily shaded with dusty-black scales. Underside: as in typical bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the sides of the abdomen not reddish or golden; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female upper and undersides: similar to those of the male, but the ground colour on the upperside white. === Variety malayica Felder === Upperside, forewing: closely resembles that of typical bulis, but the medial orange-red area is larger and extends slightly further outwards, upwards and downwards so that the black on the tornal area forms a broad triangle and is continued along the dorsal margin, narrowing to a slender line near the base of the wing; anteriorly the black border along the costa projects as a slender black tooth along the discocellulars, which however, is absent in many specimens. Hindwing: the orange-red area that in bulis forms an upper discal patch, in this variety or form spreads inwards to the base, posteriorly towards the tornus and leaves only a comparatively narrow terminal margin; the tornal area broadly black, the inner margin of the black very diffuse, rarely so clearly defined as in Felder's figure; near the base, above the subcostal vein, there is a short, broad, black streak; abdominal fold pale greyish white. Underside: silvery white, the markings faint and ill-defined as in all forms of Curetis; the discal oblique band of the forewing carried over the hindwing, but not in any specimen that I have seen continued in even a disjointed line (as in bulis) to the tornal angle. The rest as in typical bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of bulis.\u2014 Female Very similar to that of bulis. Differs on the upperside, in some specimens only, by the extent of the white area on the hindwing, which spreads practically over the whole wing, but is heavily shaded along the terminal margin and posteriorly on the dorsal area with dusky brownish-black or fuscous. On the underside the ground colour and markings are as in bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of bulis. == Life history == === Larva === About 10 mm long. Colour velvety green; head dark brown; 3rd and 4th segments with narrow, obliquely placed lateral stripes of crimson, edged posteriorly with yellow; 6th to 11th segments with a slender longitudinal dorsal stripe of the same colour; the spiracles on each side surmounted by a slender, lunulated, pale yellow line; on the 9th segment a conspicuous quadrate patch of white between the spiracular yellow lunule and the crimson dorsal line; 12th and remaining segments dark green; on the 12th two greenish-yellow, erect, rigid processes slightly divergent at their apices; the tentacles protruded from their processes seem to be pinkish brown, with a tuft of black and white hairs at their apices; but it is not easy to note the colour of the hairs, as they are protruded, whirled round and withdrawn with great rapidity. There is no opening or honey-gland on the 11th or other segment, as in many lycaenid larvae. In shape also these do not resemble the larva of the Lycaenidae which as a rule, are onisciform. In these the head is small and almost always completely hidden under the 2nd segment; the 3rd, 4th, and 5th segments sloped upwards posteriorly, form each a well-marked transverse ridge. === Pupa === A rounded slightly convex disc with a protrusion posteriorly; colour translucent dark green. Seen under a magnifying glass they seem to be studded with tiny pits, except on the lateral areas; on the anterior portion there is an oval yellowish-white mark.","cmname": "Bright sunbeam","family": "Lycaenidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "ceramas","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Taractrocera","stname": "Taractrocera Ceramas","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Taractrocera ceramas, commonly known as the Tamil grass dart, is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae.

The tornal area of the hindwing is very pale blue with serrated black markings. Underside: Both sexes are white below with black-edged brown markings and bars at end cell. The forewing has a discal band which is broken around V4 and which is broader above the break. There is a prominent black costal spot above the mid-cell. The hindwing also has a discal band broken in 4 and 6 with a prominent black spot towards the base of 7. The butterfly also has prominent orange-crowned tornal spots. == Distribution == The orchid tit is found in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, northern Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, Pulau Tioman and possibly Taiwan. In India the butterfly is found in the Western Ghats, the Himalayas from Garhwal to Assam, Bengal and onto Myanmar. In Sikkim, the orchid tit is found up to an altitude of 5,000 feet (1,500 m). == Status == The species is considered rare in southern India, but not rare in the north. == Habits == The orchid tit is to be found in dense, rainy jungles. It is rarely seen except around its food plants - the flower buds of epiphytic orchids. It flies weakly and settles on flowers, leaves. It visits damp patches. == Life cycle == Caterpillar - Green onisciform (woodlouse-shaped) larvae with red dorsal band and three red rippled lines on each side. The caterpillar's head is concealed and its body is covered with minute bristles. Distinct short protuberances extend from the anal segment. It feeds on the flowers of the orchid. Pupa - Smooth and greenish grey, resembles those of other Lycaenidae species. It has a few white markings, with a distinctly wavy pattern on the wing covers. It is found fastened along the stem of the orchids. Larval food plants - The orchid tit's larval host plants are from the family Orchidaceae from genera Arundina, Dendrobium, Papilionanthe, Phaius, Phalaenopsis, Spathoglottis and the specific species are Papilionanthe subulata and Spathoglottis plicata","cmname": "Orchid tit","family": "Lycaenidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "hemina","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Helcyra","stname": "Helcyra Hemina","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Helcyra hemina, the white emperor, is a species of brush-footed butterfly found in parts of India and in Myanmar and Java. == Subspecies == Helcyra hemina hemina (Sikkim, Assam, Burma) Helcyra hemina masinia Fruhstorfer, 1903 (western Java)","cmname": "White emperor","family": "Nymphalidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "areste","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Flos","stname": "Flos Areste","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Flos areste, the tailless plushblue, is a small butterfly found in India that belongs to the lycaenids or blues family. == Range == The butterfly occurs in India from Sikkim to Assam and the northern and southern Shan states. == Status == In 1932, William Harry Evans reported that the species was rare. == Cited references ==","cmname": "Tailless plushblue","family": "Lycaenidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "iarbus","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Rapala","stname": "Rapala Iarbus","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Rapala iarbus, the common red flash, is a species of lycaenid butterfly found in South and Southeast Asia.","cmname": "Common red flash","family": "Lycaenidae","phylum": "Arthropoda"}, {"species": "agni","order": "Lepidoptera","genus": "Coladenia","stname": "Coladenia Agni","class": "Insecta","kingdom": "Animalia","Wikipedia": "Coladenia agni is a species of spread-winged skipper butterflies.

Hindwing white, the black venation and terminal narrow black border as well as the sub-terminal vermilion-red spots between the veins on the underside show through by transparency. Underside: forewing as in D. eucharis, but the black margins to the veins much broader and the postdiscal transverse fascia as on the upperside oblique but broader. Hindwing differs from that of D. eucharis in the much deeper chrome-yellow tint of the ground colour, the postdiscal black curved band that in D. eucharis separates the yellow from the subterminal vermilion-red spots entirely wanting, the red spots themselves pointed inwardly, not subcordate, they conspicuously increase in size posteriorly. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of D. eucharis. Female differs from the female of D. eucharis on the upperside by the very much darker shading, especially on the forewing, and by the postdiscal transverse band which is as in the D. eucharis oblique but broader. Hindwing also more darkly shaded, the postdiscal transverse curved black baud entirely absent. Underside as in the female but darker, the forewing especially more thickly shaded with black scaling, the preapical interspaces tinged with yellow. Antennae, thorax and abdomen similar to those in D. eucharis. Subspecies D. h. metarete, Butler (Southern Myanmar; extending to Java and Sumatra) differs from D. h. hierta as follows: Male upperside has the ground colour a much purer white; apical half of forewing in contrast with the white on basal half densely shaded with black scales. Underside: the colours clearer and purer, the chrome yellow on the hindwing confined to the base and posterior half of the wing, the apical half of the cell and the anterior interspaces within the line of the vermilion-red spots pure white; the anterior two or three subterminal red spots margined interiorly with diffuse black scaling. Female differs less from the 2 of D. h. hierta, but on the underside of the hindwing the yellow colour is as restricted as it is in the male; the subterminal red spots are of a richer vermilion than in D. h. hierta, and the anterior two or three as in the d have an interior narrow margin of diffuse black scales. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in D. h. hierta, but the thorax and abdomen shaded slightly darker with a bluish-grey appearance. Subspecies D. h. ethire, Doherty (Madras; Orissa; Lower Bengal) differs from typical D. h. hierta as follows: Male upperside very pure white. Forewing has the black margins to the veins very narrow, the oblique postdiscal band ill defined, scarcely any irroration of black scales on the apical half of the wing. Hindwing pure white, the colours of the underside seen through by transparency as in D. h. hierta. Underside differs from D. h. hierta principally in the brighter tint of the yellow on the hindwing, and in the more clearly defined, less diffuse black margins of the veins. Female differs less from female D. h. hierta than does the male from the corresponding sex of the same insect. Upperside has the interspaces beyond the postdiscal oblique band on forewing and the cell and basal halves of the interspaces beyond the cell on the hindwing distinctly tinged with yellow. Underside: all the markings more neatly and clearly defined than in D. h. hierta, the interspaces beyond the oblique postdiscal band on the forewing bright lemon-yellow.

This irroration in many specimens is entirely wanting. Forewing: with or without a minute black spot on the discocellulars; apex broadly carmine, edged internally and externally with black, this black border varies in width, but both inner and outer borders meet on the costa and on the termen, on the latter they unite and sometimes extend as a black line to the tornus. Hindwing: uniform, except for a series of black terminal spots, which in some specimens are comparatively large and connected together by an anticiliary slender black line, in others minute, more or less obsolescent, unconnected dots. Underside: white. Forewing: base of cell washed with sulphur-yellow; spot on discocellulars as on the upperside; apical carmine area of the upperside represented by an ochraceous-pink patch, not margined with black, but similar in shape and position; in some specimens this is more or less suffused with greyish scales; in all, it is crossed near its inner edge by an obliquely placed series of four or five spots that vary in colour from pale ferruginous to black. In some specimens there are two terminal diffuse black spots, one each at the ends of veins 2 and 3. Hindwing: the ground colour generally lightly, often heavily, suffused with ochraceous pink, sometimes pure white; a small spot on the discocellulars pale ferruginous to black, sometimes annular and centred with carmine; followed by a curved macular discal band that also varies in colour from pale ferruginous to black and has the posterior spots often obsolescent, or even completely absent; a series of minute black dots at the apices of the veins that runs to the termen, and may or may not be connected by a slender black anticiliary line. Antennae pale brown, speckled with white; head, thorax and abdomen black; head and thorax anteriorly clothed with brown, sometimes greyish-black hairs; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. === Female === Upperside: white; base of wings lightly, often heavily, irrorated with greyish-black scales. In some specimens the irroration is very scanty, in others it occupies fully a third of the wings from base and extends as a broad band parallel to the dorsum on the hindwing. Forewing: an apical carmine patch as in the male but smaller, sometimes reduced to a mere row of preapical pale rosy streaks, but always bordered externally, and generally internally also, by black of varying width. In some specimens the inner black border is very narrow, in others broad, and in a very few entirely absent. The outer border again in some specimens is inwardly festooned, and may be either broad or comparatively narrow. Discocellular spot as in the male but larger, followed by an anterior, postdiscal, macular, curved, black band, the upper spots of which cross the carmine area, or when the carmine area is reduced to short streaks the band crosses the black internal edging to it, showing up in a darker tint than the edging itself; lastly, a black transverse, somewhat diffuse, spot in interspaces 1 and 2. Hindwing: with a dusky spot on the discocellulars, a black, macular, discal, curved, more or less incomplete band, and a terminal row of black spots that in some specimens are connected and form a continuous band. All these markings are generally diffuse. Underside, forewing: white, suffused with sulphur yellow at base of cell and with ochraceous (in some specimens ochraceous grey, in others ochraceous red) on apical area; spot on discocellulars, the postdiscal macular band and spots in interspaces 1 and 2 as on the upperside, but more clearly defined, the spots that compose the postdiscal band sometimes annular. Hindwing: white, suffused to a greater or less degree with, ochraceous, sometimes pink; spot on discocellulars and discal macular band as on the upperside, but both the discocellular spot and the spots that compose the latter more clearly defined, annular and generally centred with carmine; a terminal row of black specks which may or may not be connected by a very slender anticiliary line.

The butterfly ranges over the complete Indian subcontinent and is also found in the Andaman islands. The type locality is South India. == Status == As per William Harry Evans (1932), the butterfly is common in India and rare in the Andaman islands. Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth (1957) records it as Not Rare and Locally Common. Krushnamegh Kunte (2000) reports it as common in deciduous forests during the monsoon months and the evergreen forests in the following months. == Habits == A forest butterfly, the brown awl favours openings and edges of deciduous and evergreen forests while its caterpillars are to be found in moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. It flies about either late or early in the morning in the shade of the jungles. It can be sometimes seen in bright sunlight visiting flowers, such as Glycosmis, Buddleia, Chromolaena and Lantana, but is very wary and energetic at such times, moving jerkily and rapidly between flowers or across inflorescences. It can also be seen mud-puddling or at bird droppings. During a population explosion, like those of the common banded awl (Hasora chromus), the caterpillars of the brown awl may strip away all their food supply forcing the butterflies to migrate to other places where a fresh supply of host plants is available and even to other habitats such as shrubs, grasslands and gardens. The brown awl flies as low as 6 feet over the bushes or as high as 60 to 75 feet in the canopy. The adults feed at lower levels on flowers of shrubs and small trees, but ascend to higher reaches of the vegetation to lay eggs or to bask, which it does very occasionally, holding its wings flat with the forewings covering the hindwings thus giving an arrowhead effect. The flight of the butterfly is fast and bounding with an audible wing beat. When inactive, it rests on the undersides of leaves in shady forest spots, with the head pointing downwards. If disturbed it will generally buzz around energetically before returning to the same spot to rest. == Description == The brown awl is a non-descript brown butterfly, darker above and lighter below. The sexes are alike, except for three to four semi-transparent spots on the forewing which cannot be differentiated in the field. The skipper has a light-brown abdomen with black bands across it. The dry-season form is usually smaller, paler, and may not have the forewing spots. This skipper is unmistakable because of its long and narrow wings. It has the longest wings in proportion to breadth of all Indian butterflies. === Detailed description === Edward Yerbury Watson (1891) gives a detailed description: Genus characters Forewing, narrow, elongated; costa slightly arched at base, exterior margin very oblique and slightly convex below the apex; cell very long and narrow, extending three-fourths the wing; first subcostal branch emitted at two-fifths, second at one-fifth, third at one-seventh, fourth close to and fifth at end of the cell; disco-cellulars very slender, inwardly oblique, of nearly equal length, upper bent inward close to subcostal; upper radial from the angle, lower from their middle; median branches curved at their base, middle branch emitted at about one-fourth, and lower at three-fourths before end of the cell; submedian curved in the middle; hindwing short; apex very convex, angularly lobed at anal angle, abdominal margin short; precostal projecting inward; costal vein arched upward from the base; second subcostal emitted at one-third from the base; cell broad throughout; disco-cellulars very slender, scarcely visible, of equal length; radial from their angle, very slender; middle median at about one-third, and lower at one-fifth from the base; submedian straight, internal slightly curved. Thorax stout; abdomen rather long, attenuated; head broad; palpi broad and flattened in front, bristly on outer edge, third joint long,projected forward, cylindrical; fore-tibiae tufted beneath, femora slightly pilose beneath; antennae with a lengthened club and long pointed tip. Species description Upperside dark purplish brown, the base of both wings greyish olive brown. Male. Forewing with three transparent slender yellow spots disposed longitudinally on the upper disc, the inner spot ending within the cell. Female. Forewing with the spots larger, the middle spot oblique and irregularly angulated; a less distinct spot also above the middle of sub-median vein. Underside pale greyish brown: forewing with discal area darker brown, the spots as above, and pale ochreous posterior border: hindwing with a dark brown anal area bordered above by a short pale ochreous streak. Thorax greyish olive brown; abdomen dark brown with pale ochreous segmental bands; head and palpi in front pale ochreous with brown streaks; third joint of palpi brown; legs brown above, pale beneath. == Similar species == Unlike the other awls, the brown awl lacks the narrow white wing bands on the hindwings. The very distinctive characteristics of the brown awl are the characteristic shape of the body and the narrower wings than the other awls. == Life cycle == === Eggs === The brown awl lays many eggs on a single plant, one at a time, on the tips of fresh shoots. The dome-shaped egg is pale green with longitudinal ridges having fine beadings; a total 13 ridges in all. === Larva === The larva is a pale violaceous (violet) yellow, with numerous black transverse dorsal lines; the prolegs are whitish encircled with black. The head is yellow, approximately heart shaped, with a black band and many tiny black spots. On hatching the larva webs the edges of leaves together with silk to form a roomy cell from a leaf in which it resides throughout the larval stage. When disturbed, it can move quite briskly and even drop off. The caterpillars of the brown awl grow faster than most of those of other families, and have moist, sticky droppings. At the time of pupation they descend close to the ground, looking for suitable spots to pupate. The caterpillar constructs a tubular cell from a leaf by drawing the edges together with thick strands of silk. In this cell, the caterpillar prepares an extensive silk bed on which it sits awaiting pupation. The freshly formed pupa clings onto the silken pad almost immediately. === Pupa === The pupa is stubby, with protruding eyes and a prominent projection on the head in between them. The pupa may be light brown or violaceous. The body tapers away from the shoulders towards the rear. The abdomen is creamish with a row of four black spots on each side. The pupa is shiny, but plastered with a white powder. === Host plants === The caterpillars have been recorded on the following deciduous and semi-evergreen forest plants, mostly from the family Combretaceae: Large climbing shrubs of Combretum such as Combretum albidum, Combretum latifolium and Combretum ovalifolium. Large forest trees of Terminalia genus such as Terminalia bellerica, Terminalia catappa and Terminalia oblongata. Hiptage benghalensis (Malpighiaceae) Linociera purpurea.

It is found in Asia. == Description == Male Male upperside, forewing: velvety black, an elongate broad medial patch dark orange red, that extends from base outwards for about three-fourths the length of the wing and fills the area from vein 1 to the middle of the cell; in some specimens diffusely, spread below vein 1 near base, but there shaded with dusky black; the outer margin of this red patch unevenly rounded. Hindwing: brownish black, a large orange-red spot above vein 3 to near apex, inwardly extended into the cell to near the base of the wing and posteriorly diffuse below vein 3, but in the cell thickly overlaid with dusky-black scaling and posteriorly shaded with long brown hairs that in certain lights take a golden tint; above the cell extended from the base of the wing to the inner margin of the orange spot is a prominent broad streak of a shade darker than the ground colour; abdominal fold pale pinkish brown. Underside: silvery white with sparsely scattered minute black dots. Forewing: a discal and inner subterminal series of very indistinct somewhat lunular black markings that form broken anteriorly convergent bands, which are continued over the hindwing to the tornus; beyond these, on both forewings and hindwings, succeeds an outer subterminal series of minute black dots, in most specimens very indistinct. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown; sides of the abdomen golden brown; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female Female upperside: more or less as in the male, but the dark orange-red medial patches replaced by white and much larger. On the forewing this white patch extends above the cell, the discocellulars closing which are prominently marked by a black tooth, and posteriorly it reaches the dorsal margin. On the hindwing the white patch is very large and in some specimens very diffuse. Both forewings and hindwings are shaded at the base by dusky scales and in many specimens the markings of the underside are plainly visible by transparency; the broad black streak above the cell on the hindwing is present in some, absent in other specimens. Underside: ground colour and markings as in the male, but much more prominent. === Variety dentata === Male Upperside golden or coppery orange o\u00a3 a shade paler than the orange patch in the typical form. Forewing: costal margin broadly black, the width of the black colour increasing to the apex and continued from below that in an even border along the termen to the tornus, thence along the apical third of the dorsum, ending more or less diffusely in a point; discocellulars marked by a prominent tooth extended from the black costal border. Hindwing: base and dorsal area lightly irrorated (sprinkled) with fuscous scales, the latter also shaded with long pale brown hairs; termen with a blackish border of varying width but generally widest in the middle, its inner margin more or less diffuse; costal margin broadly pale yellow. Underside: silvery white; markings similar to but in some specimens even more indistinct than in bulis. Antennae, head and thorax of a paler brown than in bulis; sides of the abdomen golden yellow; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female Female upperside: similar to that of the male, but the orange replaced by white, the black costal and terminal borders on the forewing broader; on the dorsal margin the border is continued further towards the base; the diseocellular black tooth-like mark as prominent as in the male. Hindwing: the white area very much smaller than the similar orange area on the hindwing of the male and confined to the apical third of the wing; a short, broad, clavate (club like), black streak extends from the base outwards above the cell. Underside as in the male but the markings more prominent. === Variety angulata Moore === Differs from bulis in the shape of the hindwing, which has the termen very strongly angulate in the middle in both sexes. In both male and female also the apex of the fore and tornal angle of the hindwing are highly acuminate, in the forewing the apex is, in most specimens, falcate (sickle shaped). Male upperside: differs from the upperside of the typical form in the greater extent and paler colour of the orange-red areas on both forewings and hindwings. On the forewing the discocellulars are marked by a black tooth as in var. dentata, and on the hindwing the orange-red ground colour extends posteriorly to vein 2, but along the dorsum it is heavily shaded with dusty-black scales. Underside: as in typical bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the sides of the abdomen not reddish or golden; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female upper and undersides: similar to those of the male, but the ground colour on the upperside white. === Variety malayica Felder === Upperside, forewing: closely resembles that of typical bulis, but the medial orange-red area is larger and extends slightly further outwards, upwards and downwards so that the black on the tornal area forms a broad triangle and is continued along the dorsal margin, narrowing to a slender line near the base of the wing; anteriorly the black border along the costa projects as a slender black tooth along the discocellulars, which however, is absent in many specimens. Hindwing: the orange-red area that in bulis forms an upper discal patch, in this variety or form spreads inwards to the base, posteriorly towards the tornus and leaves only a comparatively narrow terminal margin; the tornal area broadly black, the inner margin of the black very diffuse, rarely so clearly defined as in Felder's figure; near the base, above the subcostal vein, there is a short, broad, black streak; abdominal fold pale greyish white. Underside: silvery white, the markings faint and ill-defined as in all forms of Curetis; the discal oblique band of the forewing carried over the hindwing, but not in any specimen that I have seen continued in even a disjointed line (as in bulis) to the tornal angle. The rest as in typical bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of bulis.\u2014 Female Very similar to that of bulis. Differs on the upperside, in some specimens only, by the extent of the white area on the hindwing, which spreads practically over the whole wing, but is heavily shaded along the terminal margin and posteriorly on the dorsal area with dusky brownish-black or fuscous. On the underside the ground colour and markings are as in bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of bulis. == Life history == === Larva === About 10 mm long. Colour velvety green; head dark brown; 3rd and 4th segments with narrow, obliquely placed lateral stripes of crimson, edged posteriorly with yellow; 6th to 11th segments with a slender longitudinal dorsal stripe of the same colour; the spiracles on each side surmounted by a slender, lunulated, pale yellow line; on the 9th segment a conspicuous quadrate patch of white between the spiracular yellow lunule and the crimson dorsal line; 12th and remaining segments dark green; on the 12th two greenish-yellow, erect, rigid processes slightly divergent at their apices; the tentacles protruded from their processes seem to be pinkish brown, with a tuft of black and white hairs at their apices; but it is not easy to note the colour of the hairs, as they are protruded, whirled round and withdrawn with great rapidity. There is no opening or honey-gland on the 11th or other segment, as in many lycaenid larvae. In shape also these do not resemble the larva of the Lycaenidae which as a rule, are onisciform. In these the head is small and almost always completely hidden under the 2nd segment; the 3rd, 4th, and 5th segments sloped upwards posteriorly, form each a well-marked transverse ridge. === Pupa === A rounded slightly convex disc with a protrusion posteriorly; colour translucent dark green. Seen under a magnifying glass they seem to be studded with tiny pits, except on the lateral areas; on the anterior portion there is an oval yellowish-white mark.","species": "bulis","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Tamil grass dart Open wing Underside","family": "Hesperiidae","genus": "Taractrocera","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Taractrocera Ceramas","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Taractrocera ceramas, commonly known as the Tamil grass dart, is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae.

The orchid tit is one of the rare butterflies belonging to the family Lycaenidae (Kehimkar, 2008). This butterfly is fairly common in northern India, but was reported to be very rare in southern India. In India, Chliaria othona is distributed in the Western Ghats, Uttaranchal to Arunachal Pradesh, the northeast, West Bengal and the Andaman Islands. It was also reported from Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The species prefers wet forests of up to 1524 meters altitude from the mean sea level and occasionally visits damp patches for mud-puddling. The caterpillars of orchid tit feed on the flower buds and flowers of orchids, hence the name. == Description == The orchid tit is a small butterfly which has a wingspan of 24 to 27 mm. The butterfly has two tails, one is 4 mm long at V1 and the other 2 mm long at V2. Upperside: Male: The butterfly is pale blue above with three-fifths of the apex black. The apex and the costa of the hindwing are more narrowly black. Female: The female butterfly is brown above with whitish lower part of the disc. The tornal area of the hindwing is very pale blue with serrated black markings. Underside: Both sexes are white below with black-edged brown markings and bars at end cell. The forewing has a discal band which is broken around V4 and which is broader above the break. There is a prominent black costal spot above the mid-cell. The hindwing also has a discal band broken in 4 and 6 with a prominent black spot towards the base of 7. The butterfly also has prominent orange-crowned tornal spots. == Distribution == The orchid tit is found in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, northern Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, Pulau Tioman and possibly Taiwan. In India the butterfly is found in the Western Ghats, the Himalayas from Garhwal to Assam, Bengal and onto Myanmar. In Sikkim, the orchid tit is found up to an altitude of 5,000 feet (1,500 m). == Status == The species is considered rare in southern India, but not rare in the north. == Habits == The orchid tit is to be found in dense, rainy jungles. It is rarely seen except around its food plants - the flower buds of epiphytic orchids. It flies weakly and settles on flowers, leaves. It visits damp patches. == Life cycle == Caterpillar - Green onisciform (woodlouse-shaped) larvae with red dorsal band and three red rippled lines on each side.

Hindwing rich hair-brown, with or without a subterminal series of white specks that increase in size anteriorly. Underside rich chocolate brown. Forewing: the cellular short streak faintly indicated, the postdiscal series of spots of the upperside not present, the subterminal series white, the spots much reduced in size. Hindwing: markings as on the upperside. Cilia dark brown alternated sparsely with white. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen velvety brown, the head and anterior portion of thorax and the thorax and abdomen beneath sparsely spotted with white. Female. Upperside, forewing: basal half dull brown, apical half brown shot with brilliant blue; markings as in the male, but larger and whiter, the spots in the postdiscal series more elongate. Hindwing brown, a series of comparatively broad whitish streaks in the cell and in all the interspaces, those in the latter end in a postdiscal series of whitish spots; beyond these a prominent subterminal series of whitish spots. Cilia brown, white in the middle of the interspaces. Underside: pale dull brown markings much as on the upperside, but larger, more diffuse, with the addition on the forewing of whitish streaks in the cell and in the interspaces posteriorly. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen blackish brown, more fully spotted with white than in the male. The second and rarer form of the female closely resembles the male, but is larger and paler, with the pale blue-glossed spots on the upperside of the forewing elongate and more prominent and the ground colour lighter than in the male. Expanse: 120\u2013150 mm Habitat: Assam, Burma, Tenasserim, extending to Siam. Papilio caunus Race danisepa, Butler- Male. Upperside rich velvety brown shot with blue. Forewing: apical third of cell, four short streaks beyond in interspaces 4,5,6 and 9 and a subterminal series of spots curved inwards opposite the apex, bluish white. Hindwing: the cell, a series of streaks from the bases of interspaces 1 to 7 and an incomplete subterminal series of minute spots, white; the streaks in interspaces 4 and 5 short, those in the interspaces above and below gradually longer. Underside brown without the blue gloss; markings as on the upperside, but the subterminal markings on the hindwing complete. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black; beneath, the thorax and abdomen with a few white spots. Female. Resembles the male, but the blue gloss on both forewing and hindwing is more restricted, the ground colour paler brown, somewhat of a rich golden bronze, and the white markings are fuller and broader. Expanse 110\u2013132&npsp;mm Habitat: The hills of Assam; Arrakan; Upper and Lower Burma; Tenasserim, extending to Siam. I first came across this magnificent butterfly on the Tannjah Pass, 1000 feet, over the Dawnat mountains in Tenasserim, and until I had caught and examined it, mistook it for an extraordinarily large speciment of Euploea rhadamanthus. It is apparently sometimes, notwithstanding its disguise, attacked and preyed upon by the Pigmy Falcon (Microhierax caerulescens), as in the nest-hole of a pair of these birds I once found the fragment of a forewing of a butterfly which was identified by the late Mr. de Niceville as belonging to this form of P. caunus. == Distribution == The butterfly is found in northern India (including Assam and Arunachal Pradesh), Bangladesh, and Myanmar. It is also found in southern China, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Kampuchea, peninsular and eastern Malaysia, Philippines (Palawan), Brunei and Indonesia (Sumatra, Banka, Nias, and Kalimantan). == Status == Never common but not known to be threatened. Considered rare in India by William Harry Evans and Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth. Only one subspecies of the butterfly occurs in Indian territory, P. (C.) p. telearchus (Hewitson), which is protected by law in India. == Habitat == This is a forest species and is generally found in low elevations. == Mimicry == The typical form of the great blue mime mimics the striped blue crow (Euploea mulciber) in both sexes. There also occurs in India a form danisepa which mimics the magpie crow (Euploea radamanthus). Though the great mimes are easily distinguished when caught, in flight they very closely resemble the mimicked butterflies. == Habits == The flight of the mime mimics that of the species it resembles. It is fond of settling on damp patches.","species": "paradoxa","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Golden birdwing Dorsal view Ventral view","family": "Papilionidae","genus": "Troides","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Troides Aeacus","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Troides aeacus, the golden birdwing, is a large butterfly belonging to the swallowtail (Papilionidae) family. == Description == For terms see External morphology of Lepidoptera. Troides aeacus has a wingspan reaching about 15\u201316 centimetres (5.9\u20136.3 in). In the males the forewings are black, with veins bordered by whitish colour, while the hindwings are bright yellow. The underside of the wings is quite similar to the upside. The females are larger than the males and have dark-brown or black wings. Head, thorax and abdomen of this butterfly are mainly black, with small red patches on the thorax and a yellow underside of the abdomen. Caterpillars are pale brown, with long protrusions resembling thorns. They mainly feed on Aristolochia and Thottea species (Aristolochiaceae).

According to Guppy and Shepard (2001), its specific name phlaeas is said to be derived either from the Greek phlego, to burn up or from the Latin floreo, to flourish. == Description == The upperside forewings are a bright orange with a dark outside edge border and with eight or nine black spots. The hindwings are dark with an orange border. Some females also have a row of blue spots inside the orange border and are known as form caeruleopunctata. The undersides are patterned in a similar way but are paler. The black spots on the forewings are outlined in yellow and the dark colouring is replaced by a pale brownish grey. The hindwings are the same brown/grey colour with small black dots and a narrow orange border. The caterpillars (larvae) are usually green, but some have a purple stripe down the middle of the back and along each side. == Range == It is widespread and common across Europe, Asia, and North America, and also found in North Africa south through to Ethiopia. It can be found almost anywhere in south/central England and Wales although never, it seems, in large numbers. Its distribution becomes more patchy in northern England, Scotland and Ireland. == Habitat == It is found in a wide variety range of habitats from chalk downlands, heathland, woodland clearings to churchyards and waste ground in cities. == Habits == In bright sun it is a very active little butterfly with the males setting up small territories which they will defend vigorously against rival males or indeed any unlucky passing insect. Even the shadow of a large bird passing overhead is enough to elicit a response. Females are pursued and mating usually occurs in vegetation. == Life cycle == The eggs are laid singly and conspicuously on the upperside of food plant leaves and the young caterpillar feeds on the underside of the leaf creating windows by leaving the upper epidermis of the leaf untouched. Pupation takes place in the leaf litter and the pupa is thought to be tended by ants. There are between two and three broods a year, fewer further north. In exceptionally good years, a fourth brood sometimes occurs in the south and adults can still be seen flying into November. The species overwinters as a caterpillar. == Host plants == Depending on the habitat, common sorrel (Rumex acetosa) and sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella) are the two main food plants, although other docks (Rumex species) are occasionally used. == Systematics == Lycaena phlaeas belongs to the subgenus Thersamolycaena of the genus Lycaena.

Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the head and thorax variegated with bluish-grey spots, the abdomen with lateral transverse bars. Race govindra, Moore very closely resembles the typical form but can always be distinguished by the presence of a complete series of postdiscal bluish-grey spots on the upperside of the hindwing. It is generally also smaller in both sexes than typical agestor, and on the upperside of the hindwing the ground colour in the anterior interspaces is broadly centred along the middle with very dark brown, almost black. The female frequently has the ground colour of the hindwing a much brighter chestnut (almost ochraceous) than in any specimen of female of agestor that the describer had seen. == Distribution == The butterfly is found in Pakistan from west Kashmir to Sikkim and right across from Assam to Myanmar (including Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea, central and southern China and peninsular Malaysia. == Status == It is never common but is not known to be threatened across most of its range. Extremely local. Considered to be vulnerable in Peninsular Malaysia. == Habitat == This butterfly frequents woods in hilly regions and generally flies between 4,000 and 8,500 feet (1,200 and 2,600 m) in the Himalayas and Assam. == Mimicry == This butterfly may mimic the chestnut tiger butterfly (Parantica sita). == Habits == The tawny mime flies slowly in the sunshine in glades and clearings of oak (Quercus) forests usually 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7 m) above the ground. It is known to patrol a beat and respond aggressively to passing butterflies and insects for long periods in a locality. It does not visit flowers. == Life cycle == It is single brooded and generally appears in March in Himachal Pradesh. The female lays her eggs on the young leaves of Machilus odorattisimus trees, Natural Order Lauraceae, about the end of April. The larva is at first of a reddish colour but very soon turns black and white, and lies on the upper surface of a leaf where it greatly and protectively resembles a bird's droppings.

Other differences are given below. == Variation == === Wet-season form === Males have the upper forewings irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales at the apex and anteriorly along the termen, much more sparsely and narrower in general than in A. paulina. On the underside, the apex of the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing are pale dull ochraceous, sometimes with a faint pinkish tint, but never pale yellow as in A. paulina. The sexes are dimorphic; the females differ as follows: 1st form: On the upperside, the posterior tornal portion of the black area on the forewing is not inwardly rounded, but straight and generally diffuse. The underside is very like the underside of the dry-season form of A. paulina female. It differs, however, in the narrowness of the oblique curved black band, the outer margin of which is irregularly zigzag, and never evenly curved as in A. paulina. 2nd form: Markings as in the 1st form, but the ground colour on the upperside is entirely pale yellow. On the underside, the apical half of the cell and the disc of the forewing up to the black band are pale sulphur yellow. The oblique curved black band is as in the 1st form and the interspace 1 is whitish. The rest of the forewing and the entire surface of the hindwing are rich chrome yellow. The antennae, head, thorax and abdomen are much as in A. paulina, but the antennae are dusky black and more closely speckled with white; the underside of the thorax is white in males, never yellow. === Dry-season form === Upper and under sides: similar to that of the wet-season specimens, but in the male the dusting of black scales on the upperside has almost, in some specimens completely, disappeared, while on the underside the ochraceous colouring is much paler. In the females both dimorphs differ but little from the dimorphs of the wet-season form, only on the upperside the black on the apical half of the forewing and on the terminal margin of the hindwing is more restricted, while on the underside the oblique curved black band that crosses the forewing is distinctly narrower with a tendency to become diffuse. The wingspan is 60-74 mm. It is found in Sikkim up to 4,000 feet (1,200 m), Bengal, western and southern India. Also extending into north-eastern India, Burma and the Malay peninsula. == Life cycle == === Larva === Light green with a yellow-white spiracular band from segments 2 & 3 to segment 12, where the band expands somewhat. Head round, shining, yellow .... covered with small conical setiferous black tubercles; body rugose, with six transverse rows from above the spiracular region over the dorsum, of small, shining, setiferous, conical black tubercles to each segment; segments 2, 12 and 13 have only a few transverse rows of such tubercles. === Pupa === Dirty whitish, with a pink shade on segments 4 to 14. The head-process from between the eyes is long, flattened at the sides, slightly curved, pointed at the extremity .... edges on ventral surface minutely serrated. The front margin of segment 2 is produced into a small subdorsal tooth, and the dorsal line is rather strongly carinated; thorax highly carinated on the dorsal line ...; lateral teeth of segments 6, 7 and 8 are all of the same size and are pointed ...; the head-production, the points on segment 2, the teeth on segments 6 and 7 (sometimes) and the extremity of the cremaster black.

Wingspan: 52\u201356 mm == Distribution and habitat == This butterfly is common in central and southern Europe, Asia Minor, Persia and Afghanistan, migrating northwards in the summer. In Central Asia, the Bath white ranges from Baluchistan, Peshawar, Chitral, Kashmir and along the Himalayas right across the Central Himalayas up to Darjeeling. The butterfly appears to be extending its range westwards along the Himalayas. It is usually found on dry slopes and rough ground with little vegetation. == Host plants == The host plants of the larvae are in the Brassicaceae family and vary according to locality. They include tower mustard (Arabis glabra) and sea rocket (Cakile maritima). == Taxonomy == The following subspecies are recognised: Pontia daplidice daplidice (Mauritania, northern Niger, northern Chad, France, south-western Europe, North Africa) Pontia daplidice laenas (Fruhstorfer, 1908) (Palestinian Territories) Pontia daplidice aethiops (de Joannis & Verity, 1913) (highlands of Ethiopia, south-western Arabia, Near East, Afghanistan) == Habitat == The butterfly lives in the Mediterranean coastal dunes, on rocky, hot slopes etc. == Pinned specimen from 1702 == The Hope Entomological Collection in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History contains a specimen of this species dating from 1702, which is the oldest pinned entomological specimen still on its original pin in existence. == Notes ==","species": "daplidice","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Pale green awlet Male (top), female, male underside","family": "Hesperiidae","genus": "Bibasis","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Burara Gomata","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Bibasis gomata, commonly known as the pale green awlet, is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae.

Upperside silvery light blue with a satiny sheen in certain lights. Forewing: the apical half of the costa narrowly and the terminal margin for varying widths fuscous black, bounded outwardly on the latter by an obscure anticiliary black line. Hindwing: the costa broadly, the termen somewhat more narrowly fuscous black as in the forewing, with the width of this dark edging similarly variable; in addition there is a very diffuse and ill-defined subterminal series of spots darker than the fuscous margin. Underside: brownish grey. Forewing: a spot in cell, a transverse lunule on the discocellulars, and a transverse anteriorly inwardly curved series of eight discal spots, black; the transverse lunule and each spot encircled with a narrow white edging; the posterior two spots of the discal series geminate (paired). Beyond these are a postdiscal and a subterminal series of short transverse dusky black spots followed by an anticiliary black line; the ground colour between the discal and postdiscal series and between the latter and the subterminal series of spots posteriorly paler than on the rest of the wing. Hindwing: a transverse, subbasal, slightly sinuate line of four spots, a short, slender, lunular line on the discocellulars, and a very strongly curved discal series of eight small spots, black; the lunule and each spot encircled with a narrow edging of white; the posterior two spots of the discal series geminate as on the forewing; beyond these as on the forewing there is a double line of dusky spots, only more lunular, with between them and between the discal and postdiscal series the ground colour in the same way followed by slightly paler; an anticiliary fine black line. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings whitey brown, darker anteriorly on the forewing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown, shafts of the antennae ringed with white; in fresh specimens the thorax and abdomen with a little light blue pubescence; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female upperside: brownish black; the basal halves of the wings slightly suffused with light blue, anticiliary black lines on both forewings and hindwings, and on the latter wing an obscure subterminal series of spots as in the male. Underside, similar,only the ground colour darker, the markings larger and more clearly defined. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male, but with no blue pubescence on the thorax and abdomen on the upperside. === Dry-season brood === Male upperside: pale bluish grey with, in some specimens, a pinkish undertone. Forewing: as in the wet-season brood, but the black terminal edging much reduced in width in some specimens to a transverse, somewhat diffuse, very narrow band that borders the anticiliary black line on the inner side, in others to a much broader similar band that coalesces with the anticiliary black line and occupies about the outer sixth of the wing. This edging along the termen is sometimes even, sometimes it widens from a slender anticiliary at and above the tornus to a broad black patch at the apex of the wing. Hindwing: the terminal black edging much narrower proportionately than in wet-season specimens, most often reduced to a slender black anticiliary line with a series of black spots on the inner side, bordering and sometimes coalescing with the line. Underside: as in the wet-season brood but the ground colour paler, in some specimens much paler, the markings on both forewings and hindwings similar, with frequently the terminal markings obsolescent, sometimes entirely absent or only indicated anteriorly on each wing. Cilia whitish. Antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen as in the wet-season specimens. Female similar to the female of the wet-season brood, but more like the male, with the light silvery-blue suffusion very irregular, but generally extended much further outwards from the base. Underside: as in the male, the ground colour slightly darker. Other variations exist: In a female from Poona, now before me, the fore wing on the upper-side has the basal half silvery blue, the outer half black; on the hind wing, however, the blue colour extends almost to the termen which is only narrowly edged with diffuse dusky black. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of the male. == Food plants == The eggs are laid on the host plants and the larvae hatch to feed on them. The plants include members of the Oxalidaceae including Oxalis corniculata, some Leguminosae and Acanthaceae. == Other studies == A study in Japan used this species to detect the side-effects of transgenic Bt corn, particularly by way of pollen falling onto leaves of the Oxalis host plants. No significant effect was found in that study. Another Japanese study showed increased abnormalities in individuals of this species subjected to radiation following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. This is part of a continuation of the study on the recent migrations of the species to northern climates, where several factors lead to the increase of abnormalities, including cold weather found in Tohoku region. == Cultural references == The album Dark Sky Island by Enya features a bonus track entitled Pale Grass Blue, a song about observing a group of the species feeding and departing.","species": "maha","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Burmese bushblue","family": "Lycaenidae","genus": "Arhopala","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Arhopala Birmana","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Arhopala birmana, the Burmese bushblue, is a species of lycaenid or blue butterfly found in Asia.","species": "birmana","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Small palm bob","family": "Hesperiidae","genus": "Suastus","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Suastus Minuta","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Suastus minuta, the small palm bob, is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae.","species": "minuta","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Scarce tortoiseshell","family": "Nymphalidae","genus": "Nymphalis","tribe": "Nymphalini","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Nymphalis Xanthomelas","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Nymphalis xanthomelas, the scarce tortoiseshell, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in eastern Europe and Asia.

It is a close relative of the small white, Pieris rapae. The large white is common throughout Europe, North Africa, Asia even through the Himalayas. == Distribution == The large white is common throughout Europe, north Africa, and Asia to the Himalayas often in agricultural areas, meadows and parkland. It has managed to establish a population in South Africa and in 1995 it was predicted to spread to Australia and New Zealand. The large white is a strong flier and the British population is reinforced in most years by migrations from the continent. Scattered reports of the large white from the north-eastern United States (New York, Rhode Island and Maine) over the past century are of a dubious nature and indicate either accidental transport or intentional release. Such introductions threaten to establish this agricultural pest in North America. In 2010 the butterfly was found in Nelson, New Zealand where it is known as the great white butterfly. It is classed as an unwanted pest due to the potential effect on crops. For a limited period in October 2013 the Department of Conservation offered a monetary reward for the capture of the butterfly. After two weeks, the public had captured 134 butterflies, netting $10 for each one handed in. As a result of this and other containment measures, such as over 263,000 searches in the upper South Island and the release of predatory wasps, the large white was officially declared to be eradicated from New Zealand as of December 2014. == Morphology == === Eggs === The large white eggs appear as a pale yellow colour. They turn into a darker yellow within twenty-four hours of being oviposited. A few hours prior to hatching, they will become black in colour, and the shell will become more transparent, and the larvae will appear visible. === Larvae === Large white larvae experience four moultings and five instars. The first instar follows hatching of the egg into large white larvae. The larvae are a light yellow in colour with distinctive brown heads and have soft bodies. The larvae appear as if they are very hairy. Following a moulting, the larvae enter the second instar. They have tubercles covered with black hair. In the third instar, large white larvae display more activity. This instar is when the larvae are observed to eat voraciously, and cause significant amounts of damage to their host plant. At this point, they are observed to be more yellow in colour, studded with black dots. Following the third instar, the larvae go through the fourth instar, with similar appearances as the larvae of the third instar, but with more aggrandized size and feeding behaviour. The large white larvae are observed to be cylindrical, robust, and elongated by the fifth instar, yellow in colour and with bright colouration on their abdomen and thorax. They are also observed to have a grey and black head. This instar requires maximum food quality and quantity in order to aid in full development, otherwise the larva dies before becoming an adult butterfly. Large white larvae are continuously growing in size with each moulting and instar. === Adult === For both males and females, the wings are white with black tips on the forewings. The female also has two black spots on each forewing. The underside of each wing is a pale greenish and serves as excellent camouflage when at rest. The black markings are generally darker in the summer brood. The large white butterfly's wingspan reaches 5 to 6.5 cm on average. ==== Male ==== The upperside of the male is creamy white. The forewing is irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales at the base and along costa for a short distance. The apex and termen above vein 2 are more or less broadly black with the inner margin of the black area containing a regular even curve. In one or two specimens a small longitudinally narrow black spot was found in interspace 3. Hindwing: uniform, irrorated with black scales at base, a large black subcostal spot before the apex, and in a few specimens indications of black scaling on the termen anteriorly. The underside of the forewing is white, slightly irrorated with black scales at the base of cell and along costa. The apex is light ochraceous brown with a large black spot in outer half of interspace 1 and another quadrate black spot at base of interspace 3. The hindwing is light ochraceous brown, closely irrorated with minute black scales. The subcostal black spot before the apex shows through from the upperside. The antennae are black and white at apex. The head, thorax, and abdomen are black, with some white hairs, where underneath is whitish. ==== Female ==== The upperside of the female is similar to that of the male, but the irroration of black scales at the bases of the wings is more extended. The black area on apex and termen of forewing is broader, its inner margin less evenly curved. A conspicuous large, black spot also exists in the outer half of interspace 1 near the base of interspace 3. On the hindwing the subcostal black spot before the apex is much larger and more prominent. The underside is similar to that of the male but the apex of the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing is a light ochraceous yellow, not ochraceous brown. The black discal spots on forewing are much larger. The antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen of the females are the same as for the male. == Habitat == The large white butterfly's habitat consists of large, open spaces, as well as farms and vegetable gardens, because of the availability of its food source. Some favoured locations include walls, fences, tree trunks, and often their food plant, which is important for large white survival since they need to have access to their food source for survival. They primarily hover around these locations, which should contain both wild and cultivated crucifer, as well as oil-seed rape, cabbages, and Brussels sprouts. == Reproduction and development == === Mating system === These butterflies can be polyandrous, but it is not the predominant mating system. This means that, though some female butterflies can have more than one mate, most of the large white females only have one male mate at a time through a monogamous mating system. Two generations of butterflies are produced each year. The first brood consists of adults with a spring hatching around April. The second brood is made up of adults that hatch around July. Sometimes, a third brood can be observed farther along in the summer if the weather is warm enough. === Life cycle === ==== Oviposition ==== These female butterflies oviposit eggs in bunches on the undersides of leaves because the larvae prefer the morphology of leaf undersides over the upper surface of leaves. To oviposit, the female butterflies use the tip of the abdomen and arrange the eggs in specific batches. The pre-oviposition period, which lasts three to eight days, provides ample time for these butterflies to mate. Females tend to use their forelegs to drum on the surfaces of their intended leaves as a test of the plant's suitability for breeding. If they find a suitable surface, female large whites oviposit two to three days following copulation. They oviposit approximately six to seven times in eight days. The females can pair up to mate again approximately five or more days after the previous mating. ===== Choosing locations for oviposition ===== Females rely on visual cues, such as the colours of plants, to decide where to lay their eggs. They favour green surfaces in particular to display oviposition behaviour. This colour preference could be due to the fact that the large white's food source also acts as a host plant for oviposition. Most females choose nectar plants like buddleia or thistles, which are green and ideal plants for the larvae. These plants, used as oviposition sites, typically contain mustard oil glucosides, whose primary function is to help the larvae survive as their essential food source. For instance, previous studies have shown that the large white larvae do not survive if the adult butterflies oviposit on a different host plant such as broad bean (Vicia faba) because this bean does not contain the proper nutrients to aid in larval development. ==== Hatching ==== The large white eggs hatch approximately one week after being laid and live as a group for some time. The hatching period constitutes around two to seven hours. Upon hatching, they cause a lot of damage to the host plant by eating away at and destroying the host plant. == Behaviour == === Migration === The large whites are found throughout most of Eurasia, though there are some seasonal fluctuations present due to migration. The northern populations tend to be augmented during the summer migration season from butterflies from southern areas. The large whites fly starting early spring, and keep migrating until seasons shift to autumn and the resultant cold weather. This means the large whites typically take two to three flights per butterfly reproductive season. Large white butterfly migration patterns are typically observed only when there is a disturbance. In general, the large white butterfly's migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate Equator during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed. However, it has been hard to track entire migratory paths, since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended. === Hibernation === Large white broods in the north have not been seen to overwinter, or hibernate over the winter, successfully. However, they have been observed to hibernate in the south. === Territorial behaviour === Males do not display considerable amounts of territorial behaviour. It has been suggested that this could be a reason why there is no observed significant sexual dimorphism between the male and female large white butterflies. == Ecology == === Diet and food selection === Large white butterflies have a preference for what types of food plant they usually eat. Studies have shown that the preference for certain plants is reliant upon the butterflies' previous experiences. The large white butterflies, then, are shown to rely on the species of food plants, the time of experience, and the choice-situation. Thus, the large white butterflies learn what types of foods they prefer, rather than relying on their sense organs or physiological changes. In contrast, this preference for adult food plant differs from the preference of female large whites using visual cues such as plant colour to determine the best host plants for oviposition. Plants with mustard-oil glucosides are important for this butterfly because it dictates their eating behaviours, and resultant survival rates, as specified in the section regarding oviposition. This is so beneficial for large whites because their large consumption of plants containing mustard oils is the specific reason they are so distasteful to predators, such as birds. Thus, caterpillars are protected from attack, despite them being brightly coloured; in fact, the bright colouration is to signal to predators that they taste bad. However, there is more benefit to this species' use of mustard oil glucosides. In addition to predator protection, these glucosides belong to a class of stimuli that produce the biting responses associated with eating. Some plants contain alkaloids and steroids; these reduce and inhibit the butterflies' responsiveness to mustard oil glucosides. Thus, this utilization of mustard oil glucosides dramatically affects the behaviour of the butterfly, and the resulting food selection for survival. The food source of the larva of the white butterfly are cabbages, radishes, and the undersides of leaves. Adults feed on flower nectar. === Predators === Large white butterflies do not have a specific group of predators. Instead, they are preyed upon by a wide range of animals, and even the occasional plant. This butterfly's main predators include birds; however, large whites can also be preyed upon by species in orders such as Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Arachnid; some species of mammals, one of reptiles, one species of insectivorous plant, and species in amphibian orders, as well as other miscellaneous insect species. The butterflies are typically preyed upon as eggs, larvae, and imagines. === Aposematism === Large white butterflies emit an unpleasant smell which deters predators. In addition, large whites are an aposematic species, meaning that they display warning colours, which benefits the large whites against predation. This aposematic colouration occurs in the larval, pupal, and imago stages, where toxic mustard oil glycosides from food plants are stored in the individuals' bodies. Aposematism is not entirely related to M\u00fcllerian mimicry; however, large white larvae often benefit from multiple other aposematic larvae from other species, such as the larvae of Papilio machaon. == Relationship to people == === Role as pests === The crops most susceptible to P. brassicae damage in areas in Europe are those in the genus Brassica (cabbage, mustard, and their allies), particularly Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, rape, swede, and turnip. The attacks to crops are rather localized and can lead to 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of P. brassicae are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, P. brassicae are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.","species": "brassicae","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Common earl","family": "Nymphalidae","genus": "Tanaecia","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Tanaecia Julii","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Tanaecia julii, the common earl, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in South and South-East Asia.","species": "julii","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Tranvancore Evening Brown","family": "Nymphalidae","genus": "Parantirrhoea","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Parantirrhoea Marshalli","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "The Tranvancore Evening Brown (Parantirrhoea marshalli) is a species of butterfly endemic to the Western Ghats of India.

Locally abundant, it is common from Sri Lanka to Maharashtra. It is rare in Gujarat and far more common in the Himalayas. == Ecology == The commander is generally found in forested regions having moderate to heavy rainfall. It usually keeps to low elevations, that is, up to 900 metres (3,000 ft) into the hills. It is fond of open glades, roadsides and clearings in forests. It is abundant along watercourses in dry and moist deciduous forests. It is also found close to villages or wherever its larval host plant Mussaenda frondosa is found. It is most common in the post-monsoon months and winter. The commander can often be spotted basking with its wings pressed flat on exposed stones in streambeds. Individuals settle down on an exposed perch high up in the trees during the heat of the day. At this time it can be seen defending its territory and driving intruding butterflies away. This butterfly has a swift flight with rapid wingbeats and alternate spurts of smooth gliding. A powerful flier, it nevertheless flies for short distances at a time. Being wary, it maintains its distance and is best caught when engrossed in mud-puddling or feeding from flowers. It regularly visits flowers from low-lying herbs to high up in the trees. Though this is a mud-puddling species, in Borneo and probably elsewhere, adults do not visit carrion or old fruit to drink liquids. === Host plants === Most of the larval host plants belong to the family Rubiaceae. Neolamarckia cadamba (kadam) Mussaenda erythrophylla Mussaenda frondosa Wendlandia thyrsoidea Wendlandia exserta Cinchona species (quinine trees) Cadaba fruitcosa Mitragyna parvifolia Hedyotis orixense Ochreinauclea missionis == Life cycle == === Egg === The female commander lays a single egg on the underside of the tip of a leaf of the food plant. The egg is hairy and greenish and looks like a green strawberry. The egg hatches in 3 to 4 days. === Caterpillar === The caterpillar is dirty brown with a chestnut tinge and dark brown splotches all over. The body also bears numerous processes which help to break up its outline. The behaviour of this caterpillar is very interesting in that it is one of the species of butterfly that makes long chains of frass. It eats up part of the leaf it is on and uses bits of leaves which are strung up with silk along with droppings. The caterpillar rests on the exposed mid-rib of a leaf after removing the leafy portions on the sides. This behaviour may be to dissuade ants from crossing over the chain of frass behind which the caterpillar rests. === Pupa === Before pupating, the caterpillar wanders around, often far away from the plant it fed on. It pupates among dried leaves and twigs. The pupa is brownish and rough in texture. It is angular with prominent wing expansions and bears flat processes on the head which curl together making a hole between them. It also has numerous lines and markings that make it look like a rolled up dried leaf.","species": "procris","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Chestnut-streaked sailer","family": "Nymphalidae","genus": "Neptis","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Neptis Jumbah","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Neptis jumbah, the chestnut-streaked sailer, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in South Asia. == Description == The male somewhat resembles Neptis columella, but differs as follows: Upperside fuliginous black, the interspaces between the veins deeper black, very conspicuous in certain lights, particularly so between the subbasal and postdiscal markings on the hindwing; the white markings suffused with very pale bluish green; the posterior two spots of the discal series on the forewing subequal; the postdiscal macular band on the hindwing with a tendency to obsolescence, varying from a narrow series of white lunules to a somewhat diffuse transverse narrow pale band.

It is common but not found in all the Ghat districts of Maharashtra and does not occur in Gujarat at all (Gaonkar). However, there are recent records confirmed from Gujarat as far as up to Surat. == Description == Sexes alike. Wingspan - 26 to 28 mm. Upperside - The butterfly is dark brown. It has a white spot end cell. It has narrow white spots on 2 and 3 which form a short band on the forewing. On the upper hindwing it has two black tornal spots and narrow dark reddish spot above them. Underside - The butterfly is white to dark yellowish brown. Forewing has irregular dark basal markings with a curved white discal line. The apical two-fifths are a rich dark brown colour. The hindwing has a silvery margin with many irregular black lines and spots within. It has three tails, being 2 mm, 6 mm and 2.5 mm in length. == Habits == This butterfly is found in jungle areas of moderate to heavy rainfall, in heavy forest and scrub. The butterfly occurs below 900 meters or so. It keeps to undergrowth and can be seen along forest paths and in clearings. The butterfly has a weak flight, it stays low and does not fly for long without alighting. Its method of alighting is interesting - as soon as it lands, it turns around and waggles its tail filaments, it also sidesteps for a while - all this is apparently to confuse a predator as to which side is the head. This is a likely reason that the first naturalists may have named the species the monkey puzzle. == Life cycle == === Larva === The larva is unusual for a lycaenid. It is pale green and has a long line of fleshy protrusions along the back. The protuberances near the head are branched in two. On the fourth segment the protuberance is straight and has a sharp point. The last segments have two protuberances each curved outwards. The last protuberance is curved outwards and upwards. According to Evans, the larva supposedly resembles a monkey's head hence the name. === Pupa === The pupa is green and turns brown as it nears maturity. The back of the abdomen is pink and smooth. The pupa is attached by one point only - by a long stalk at the tail. == Food plants == The butterfly has a number of food plants from families Rubiaceae, Dipterocarpeae, Euphorbiaceae, Loranthaceae, Sapindaceae and Myrtaceae and the species Mangifera indica and Meiogyne pannosa.","species": "amor","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Paintbrush swift In Kadavoor","family": "Hesperiidae","genus": "Baoris","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Baoris Farri","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Baoris farri, commonly known as the paintbrush swift, is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae.

Flying strongly and swiftly close to the ground, the albatross is frequently found in jungle clearings and along stream banks. The males are often found circling around trees and bushes. The chocolate albatross often mudpuddles, sometimes in large numbers. The butterfly occasionally visits flowers and has been recorded to visit Verbena flowers in Kodagu. == Life cycle == The larvae have been recorded on Crataeva religiosa, Capparis roxburghii and Capparis heyneana.","species": "lyncida","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Nilgiri tiger Conservation status Near Threatened (IUCN 2.3)[1]","family": "Nymphalidae","genus": "Parantica","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Parantica Nilgiriensis","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Parantica nilgiriensis, the Nilgiri tiger, is a butterfly found in the Western Ghats and Nilgiri Hills of southern India. It belonging to the danaid group of the brush-footed butterflies family. Parantica nilgiriensis is a near-threatened (IUCN 2-3), butterfly endemic to the high altitudes of the Western Ghats of southern India, belonging to the family Nymphalidae and sub-family Danainae . It is restricted to the shola forests, south of Nilgiri Hills, in the temperate zones of the mountains, above 1500 m, though the species occasionally shows up in home gardens and open country to visit flowering plants. It rarely flies as low as 1000 m (Larsen 1987). Though Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth (1957) mentions it as a common species, it has seen a rapid decline in the density of its population over the last few decades, owing to rapid destruction of its habitats, mostly due to tea-monocultures in the mountain ranges. [Pulikkal U. 2009] Species that closely resemble P. nilgiriensis are P. fumata (Butler), a Sri Lankan endemic and P. aglea (Stoll), a common species of low elevations of India, Sri Lanka and other south East Asian countries. == Behaviour == Egg-laying behaviour: The adult female flies continuously around healthy host plants, occasionally stopping to lay eggs on suitable fresh leaves. It fixes itself on the edge of the leaf using its forelegs, maintaining slow wing beats to keep it alighted, slowly bends its abdomen downwards to lay the egg on the underside of the leaf. It lays several eggs in a session, laid singly, at times with two or more eggs on a single leaf, always maintaining some distance between individual eggs. [Pulikkal U. 2009] Adult behaviour: The flight is rapid, low and erratic for a Danaid, giving the impression that it may not be protected species. It is often seen in numbers on flowering trees or on the occasional Lantana in clearings in Sholas. From time to time it is also met with sipping moisture from water seepages in vertical banks in the forest or along clear brooks, something that may also be observed in other montane butterflies [Larsen 1987]. Host plants: Tylophora tenuis and T. indica. It does not seem to feed on Calotropis sp. which its close cousin P. aglea feeds on. [Pulikkal U. 2009] == Description == Eggs: Eggs are white, shiny, dome-shaped and ribbed. [Pulikkal U. 2009] Larva: Eggs hatches on the fourth or fifth day. The first instar is a small, pearly white caterpillar with a prominent black head and dark grey legs. It has small paired tubercles on second and twelfth segments, which are precursors of future tentacles. The second instar is larger and begins to show up purplish ground colour with white, oval and round spots similar to what is seen on the mature caterpillar. There are four longitudinal rows of round spots \u2013 two dorsal and two lateral rows on each side. All the spots in the lateral rows and those on the first two segments and the last three segments are yellow. There is a pair of small tentacles on the second segment and a pair of tubercles on the twelfth segment. In the third and fourth instars the basic morphology remains the same except that the caterpillar grows in length and thickness, the tentacles elongates and the white spots gradually turn yellow on all segments. The fifth instar is about 6\u20137 cm long with long, thin, black tentacles on second and twelfth segments, the first pair being longer. In this stage all the white spots of the four longitudinal rows have turned yellow, with dark purple ground colour. The other smaller spots and short streaks remain grayish white. The caterpillar takes 14\u201315 days to complete its growth before it prepares for pupation. [Pulikkal U. 2009] Larval behaviour: The first and second instars of the larva show the strange behaviour of \u2018silk diving\u2019 \u2013 the caterpillar simply falls down, when alarmed, and hangs on its own silk thread \u2013 a protective, predator-avoidance strategy shown by some of the Nymphalids but unknown in any of the danaids. As the caterpillar matures, however, they seldom show this behaviour. (There was no nipping of the midrib before feeding.) [Pulikkal U. 2009] Pupa: Pupa is green with shining silvery and black spots. It hangs freely from the underside of a leaf or twig, appearing very similar to that of plain tiger Danaus chrysippus. The duration of pupal stage is 11\u201312 days. The pupa begins to show up the pattern of the underlying wings on the eve of eclosion. It turns very dark, nearly black, on the night before hatching. [Pulikkal U. 2009] Adult: Wingspan \u2013 80-90mm. Both male and female are dull brownish black with dirty white markings above. The streaks are narrower and the spots smaller than those of P. aglea and T. limniace. The markings are much less extensive than the background. Cells are dark with a pale streak. Male has patch of scent scales on the hindwing [Wynter-Blyth 1957]. From Charles Thomas Bingham's, The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma, Butterflies.

It occurs in the plains and hills up to 7,000 feet (2,100 m). It is found in jungle and open country in areas of light and heavy rainfall. == Description == Both sexes: Wingspan 45-50 mm. The male and female are dark vinaceous (colour of red wine) brown. The cilia is greyish brown while the head and thorax are greenish brown. The abdomen, third joint of palpi and the legs are also brown; the palpi and thorax beneath are dull yellow. Below, the hindwing is dark brown with more of less of dull blue-greyish gloss.

White banded awl (Hasora taminatus) (H\u00fcbner, 1818) \u2013 The white band is broad, sharply defined and generally uniform in width. Common awl (Hasora badra) (Moore, 1857) \u2013 It resembles the common banded awl but lacks the white band. It has rust colouring and a white spot on the underside of the hindwing. == Habits == In India, the common banded awl is the commonest of the awls or Coeliadinae subfamily of skippers. It has a rapid and whirring flight which is audible at close quarters. It is less averse to sunshine than other awls and is often found flying around bushes in bright sunshine. It can be seen visiting flowers early in the day and sometimes basks on leaves, often with its wings slightly parted. It rests with wings closed. == Life cycle == Eggs: Laid singly on young shoots, or on new leaves, both above and below. The egg is pinkish white when laid, dome shaped with a flattened top, and with minute longitudinal ridges. These are bead patterned and have fine transverse striations. The egg turns dirty white as it matures.Caterpillar: The caterpillar is cylindriform with a constricted second segment which appears as a neck with a black collar. The head is lobed, rounded and yellowish red in colour. The caterpillar is yellowish black with brown sides which range from pale to dark brown in colour. The markings are very variable. The caterpillar is greenish white below tinged with yellow. Sometimes the green extends all over the body along with the dark markings. When newly born, the caterpillar eats the eggshelf, usually incompletely and scuttles off to a leaf where it hurriedly makes a cell for itself. Active when young, it becomes lethargic as it grows. The caterpillar ventures forth to feed only when the light is very low and at night.Pupa: The pupa is stout, pale brown, with white abdomen and a prominent projection on the head between bulbous eyes. == Cited references ==","species": "chromus","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Black forester","family": "Nymphalidae","genus": "Lethe","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Lethe Vindhya","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Lethe vindhya, the black forester, is a species of Satyrinae butterfly found in India and Indochina.","species": "vindhya","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Mixed Punch","family": "Riodinidae","genus": "Dodona","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Dodona Ouida","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "Dodona ouida, the mixed Punch, is a small but striking butterfly found in India that belongs to the Punches and Judies, that is, the family Riodinidae. == Description == From Charles Thomas Bingham's The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma, Butterflies, (1905) Vol. 1: Male.

The empty shell has a close superficial resemblance to an echinus shell. In colour pale ochreous, furnished with long stout white hairs of which a subdorsal series is on each side, with one long hair springing from the apex of each tubercle; there are, besides, other lateral series and numerous hairs projecting forwards in front of the head and backwards over the anal segment. The full-grown larva is the most beautiful known to me among the Lycaenidae.....of the exact shade of green of the leaves on which it feeds..... The second segment is quite unmarked; the third to the thirteenth have a subdorsal series of short oblique pale yellowish-green lines between which the ground-colour is paler than the rest of the body; there is a dark green dorsal line; on each side of the ninth segment there is a prominent pure dead-white, somewhat diamond-shaped mark. De Niceville goes on to say that the sheaths of the tentacles on the twelfth segment are pale green, the tentacles themselves maroon, the whorl of hairs at their apices white with their basal thirds black. The larvae have tentacular organs as seen on myrmecophilous lycaenids, but they have not been observed to be tended by ants. === Pupa === Light green; wing-cases bluish green.

This butterfly has a strange pattern of flying in a sort of screw shape. == Description == == Distribution == V. cardui is one of the most widespread of all butterflies, found on every continent except Antarctica and South America. In Australia, V. cardui has a limited range around Bunbury, Fremantle, and Rottnest Island. However, its close relative, the Australian painted lady (V. kershawi, sometimes considered a subspecies) ranges over half the continent. Other closely related species are the American painted lady (V. virginiensis) and the West Coast lady (V. annabella). == Migration == V. cardui occurs in any temperate zone, including mountains in the tropics. The species is resident only in warmer areas, but migrates in spring, and sometimes again in autumn. It migrates from North Africa and the Mediterranean to Britain in May and June, but for decades, naturalists have debated whether the offspring of these immigrants ever make a southwards return migration. Research suggests that British painted ladies do undertake an autumn migration, making a 9,000-mile round trip from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle in a series of steps by up to six successive generations. The Radar Entomology Unit at Rothamsted Research provided evidence that autumn migrations take place at high altitude, which explains why these migrations are seldom witnessed. V. cardui is known for its distinct migratory behavior. In California, they are usually seen flying from north to northwest. These migrations appear to be partially initiated by heavy winter rains in the desert where rainfall controls the growth of larval food plants. Painted lady migration patterns are highly erratic and they do not migrate every year. Some evidence suggests that global climatic events, such as el Ni\u00f1o, may affect the migratory behavior of the painted lady butterflies, causing large-scale migrations. Based on experimental data, the painted lady\u2019s migration pattern in Northern Europe apparently does not follow a strict northwest heading. The range of headings suggests that migrating butterflies may adjust their migration patterns in response to local topographical features and weather, such as strong wind patterns. Laboratory-raised autumn-generation painted lady butterflies were able to distinguish a southern orientation for a return migration path. According to the same laboratory-based study, when butterflies were isolated from the sun, they were unable to orient themselves in a specific direction, opposed to those that did have access to the sun. This suggests that V. cardui requires a direct view of the sky, implying the use of a solar compass to orient its migratory direction and maintain a straight flight path. == Mating behavior in relation to migration == V. cardui displays a unique system of continuous mating, throughout all seasons, including the winter. This may be attributed to its migratory patterns, thus significantly affecting its mating behavior. During European migrations, the butterflies immediately begin to mate and lay eggs upon arrival in the Mediterranean in the spring, starting in late May. In the United States, painted lady butterflies migrating towards the north experience poor mating conditions, and many butterflies have limited breeding capabilities. The \u201clocal adult generation\u201d develops during this time, roughly from the middle of May through early June in conjunction with the butterfly progression throughout their flight. During its migratory process, these painted lady butterflies start breeding, and reproduce entirely throughout their migration. Scientists have not been able to find evidence of their overwintering; this may be because they migrate to warmer locations to survive and reproduce. Female painted lady butterflies may suspend their flight temporarily when they are \u201cready to oviposit\u201d; this allows them the opportunity to continually reproduce throughout their migrations. Because these butterflies are constantly migrating, male butterflies are thought to lack consistent territory. Instead of requiring territory to mate with females and developing evolutionary behavior to defend this territory, the mating butterflies appear to establish a particular \u201ctime and place\u201d in certain locations that they find to be suitable for reproduction. More specifically, they locate certain perches, hilltops, forest-meadow edges, or other landmarks where they will stay until, presumably, a female to mate. Equally important for the reproduction of the painted lady butterflies is the males\u2019 exhibition of polygynous mating behavior, in which they often mate with more than one female. This is important for painted lady butterflies because the benefits may supersede the costs of polygyny since no permanent breeding ground is used. Upon mating, which typically occurs in the afternoon, female painted lady butterflies lay eggs one by one in their desired breeding locations. The variety of eclosion locations ultimately dictates the male painted lady behavior. Female painted lady butterflies have been observed to have a relatively \u201chigh biotic potential\u201d, meaning they each produce large numbers of offspring. This perpetual influx of reproduction may be a reason why these painted lady butterflies have propagated so successfully. One interesting aspect that scientists have observed is that these butterflies like to fly towards rain. Further studies have suggested that the large amounts of rainfall may somehow \u201cactivate more eggs or induce better larval development\u201d. Inhabited locations begin to observe a large influx of new generations of painted lady butterflies in the fall, particularly in September and October. Their reproductive success declines relatively throughout the winter, primarily through November. However, they still continue to reproduce\u2014an aspect of butterfly behavior that is quite unique. Scientists hypothesize that these extensive migratory patterns help the painted lady butterflies find suitable conditions for breeding, thus offering a possible reason as to why these butterflies mate continuously. == Oviposition == Adult butterflies feed on flower nectar and aphid honeydew. Females oviposit on plants with nectar immediately available for the adults even if it leads to high mortality of the larvae. This lack of discrimination indicates they do not take into account volatile chemicals released from potential host plants when searching for oviposition choices. The availability of adult resources dictates preference for specific areas of flowers. Flowers with more available nectar result in a larger number of eggs deposited on the plants. This reinforces the idea that the painted lady butterfly does not discriminate host plants and chooses mainly on availability of adult food sources even if it increases mortality rate of the offspring. The data also suggest that the painted lady butterfly favors quantity of offspring over quality. == Roosting behavior and territory == Groups of two to eight Painted Lady butterflies have been observed to fly in circles around each other for about one to five seconds before separating, symbolizing courtship. Groups of butterflies usually will not fly more than 4.5 m away from the starting point. To establish and defend their territories, adult males perch in the late afternoon in areas where females are most likely to appear. Once the male spots a female of the same species, he begins pursuit of her. If the foreign butterfly is a male, the original male will give chase, flying vertically for a few feet before returning to his perch. V. cardui establishes territories within areas sheltered by hedgerows. Vanessa cardui tend to inhabit sunny, brightly lit, open environments and are often attracted to open areas of flowers and clovers. Adults spend time in small depressions in the ground on overcast days. == Host plants == Larvae feed on Asteraceae species, including Cirsium, Carduus,Centaurea, Arctium, Helianthus, and Artemisia. The painted lady uses over 300 recorded host plants according to the HOSTS database. == Defense mechanisms == The main defense mechanisms of the painted lady butterflies include flight and camouflage. The caterpillars hide in small silk nests on top of leaves from main predators that include wasps, spiders, ants, and birds. == Human interaction == Vanessa cardui and other painted lady butterflies are bred in schools for educational purposes and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events and weddings.","species": "cardui","class": "Insecta"}, {"cmname": "Common palmfly Race caudata female in Southern India","family": "Nymphalidae","genus": "Elymnias","order": "Lepidoptera","stname": "Elymnias Hypermnestra","kingdom": "Animalia","phylum": "Arthropoda","Wikipedia": "The common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra) is a species of satyrine butterfly found in South and Southeast Asia. == Description == As in some other species in the genus Elymnias, the common palmfly has a precostal cell in the hindwings and a tuft of androconial scales on the dorsal discal cell of the hindwings.

It is found from southern India to Japan and its larval food plants include members of the Cannabaceae, particularly in the genera Celtis and Trema. == Description == The species was earlier considered a race of Libythea celtis, the European beak. The following description is based on the older treatment and the race lepita and lepitoides described below refer to this species. === Race lepita Moore === Race lepita ranges from the Himalayas (Shimla and Sikkim to Assam) to upper Myanmar, China and Japan. It differs from the European beak Libythea celtis as follows: Upperside ground colour a slightly darker brown. Forewing: orange-yellow streak in cell much narrower for two-thirds of its length from base, then abruptly expanded anteriorly so as to fill the apex of the cell, the inner margin of the apical portion and the anterior margin of the basal portion forming a clearly defined right angle; lower discal spot absent, upper larger discal spot somewhat diamond shaped; subcostal spot and preapical spot placed obliquely outwards from it more distinctly double, the lower portion of the subapical spot orange-yellow, the upper portion and the subcostal spot white. Hindwing: the upper postdiscal orange patch narrower, forming a short band which is not curved but placed obliquely transverse, reaching from vein 2 to vein 6, sometimes but rarely with a detached orange spot above it in interspace 6. Underside: ground colour variable, generally vinous brown, paler along the costal and dorsal margins of the forewing; sometimes dark brown on the forewing, dark greyish on the hindwing, with the costal margin broadly of the forewing and the whole of the hindwing irrorated with minute dark striae and spots. Orange and white markings on the forewing as on the upperside, but the preapical double spot entirely white. The hindwing is more variable; in some specimens it is uniform without any markings, in others it is shaded transversely light and dark, and in a few specimens the wing is longitudinally divided by a dark-brown diffuse band from base along the median vein to apex of vein 5. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in L. celtis. === Race lepitoides Moore === Race lepitoides ranges from southern India to Sri Lanka, and differs from lepita as follows: Hindwing: tornus narrowly produced, dentate or even, subcaudate. Upperside: ground colour darker brown. Forewing: the orange-yellow streak in cell divided from the spot in the apex of the cell, the large discal spot smaller, the subcostal and subapical spots more distinctly double, the latter pure white. Hindwing: the transverse short band narrower and more horizontal; a diffuse quadrate pale spot in the middle of interspace 7, larger in the female than in the male. Underside forewing: ground colour dark brown, the apex, the termen narrowly and slightly, and the dorsal margin somewhat broadly touched with grey, irrorated with minute dark dots and transverse striae; the orange-yellow and white markings as on the upperside, the former broader and fuller, the cellular streak not interrupted. Hindwing pale grey, shaded broadly at base, on the disc and posteriorly, with brown, the pale grey ground colour prominently replacing the transverse orange streak and pale subcostal spot of the upperside. In some specimens there is a very dark brown shading from base of the wing along the median vein. The entire surface of the wing is irrorated with minute dots and transverse short striae.

The Vanessa indica is not reported as a pest on any crop but on ramie it is causing considerable damage by feeding on young tender leaves which affect the growth of the plant. The larvae of this insect pest feed on tender young leaves as shown in the picture. The adults lay the eggs on tender leaves in which larvae emerge and feeds on young tender leaves preferably at neck region of the leaves, due to this leaves look likes the hanging like position and latter get dry. The caterpillar feeds on young leaves and latter fold the leaves in such a way that both the margins get attached by silky web and pupation takes place inside the folded leaf. Latter the adult emerge as a beautiful Indian butterfly.
